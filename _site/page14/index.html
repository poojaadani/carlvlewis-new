<p>Ready, set, shop. It’s a sales-tax holiday.</p>
<p>The four-day sales-tax holiday kicked off Thursday, and many area stores saw crammed parking lots and congested shopping aisles as a result.</p>
<p>So far, in 2009, retail sales nationwide have dropped about 5 percent, said John Heavener, president of the Georgia Retail Association. But in Georgia, numbers could be better than in other states because of this weekend’s sales tax holiday, which promises to lure in cash-strapped consumers who might not otherwise make purchases.</p>
<p><!--more-->“We believe that with the combination of strong discounts and the sales-tax holiday, Georgia can stay above the national retail average,” Heavener said.</p>
<p>It’s still early in the weekend, but area stores are bracing for the best, too.</p>
<p>Retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target and those in the Macon Mall said they expect to see full parking lots Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Already, before the end of the workweek, some stores have noticed a frenzy of consumers reaping the discounts of the holiday.</p>
<p>At the Best Buy store on Presidential Parkway in Macon, hordes of shoppers came out Thursday to save money on high-ticket computers and accessories.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a lot more customers than usual,” said store manager Eli Douglass. “We haven’t seen this amount of people in a while.”</p>
<p>One of those customers, Patricia Adams, bought a new laptop which she plans to use to communicate with her son, who is a Marine deployed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“I’ve been needing a computer so I can e-mail him, but I’ve been holding out to buy it until this weekend,” she said. “Now I’ll feel a little closer to him while he’s overseas.”</p>
<p>At Staples, back-to-school shoppers such as Adrienne Bershinski, took advantage of the sales-tax break to stock up on supplies.</p>
<p>“I’m on a tight budget lately, so I figured I’d get my school shopping out of the way when I can avoid the extra tax,” said Bershinski, who starts class at Mercer University’s Walter F. George School of Law next month.</p>
<p>Clothing qualifies for the sales-tax holiday, too, and many area department stores have made the necessary preparations for the weekend.</p>
<p>At the Kohl’s on Watson Boulevard in Warner Robins, 20 extra employees will be on hand to handle the spike in traffic, manager Derek Meredith said.</p>
<p>“We’re expecting a lot more shoppers, especially in the clothing and shoes departments,” Meredith said.</p>
<p>At the Target in Macon on Thursday, Peche Ellis, of Griffin, was one of the first of those shoppers. She filled her cart with new blouses and dresses for fall.</p>
<p>“I only meant to buy one dress coming in here. But after seeing what better deals I can get, I’m buying a lot more than I expected,” she said.</p>
<p>The tax-free weekend will last through Sunday. Only school supplies, clothing and certain electronics qualify.</p>

<p>Owner can't afford $10,000 extermination price tag</p>
<p>By Carl Lewis</p>
<p>Saturday Jul. 18, 2009</p>
<p>[/box]</p>
<p>COCHRAN — It smells foul on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Really, really foul.</p>
<p>Walking down the street toward Victoria Jackson’s home, the musky stench gets even worse. Stepping inside, it grows almost unbearable.</p>
<p>“It’s a very, very bad odor,” the homeowner said.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-11  alignright" title="MA.BATS" src="/assets/MA.jpeg" alt="MA.BATS" width="155" height="307" /></p>
<p>It’s the scent of the droppings from what exterminators estimate are more than 1,000 bats that have made Jackson’s home their roosting spot.</p>
<p><!--more-->Jackson, 70, has been living with bats since she moved into the house in 1983, but the problem’s gotten worse in the last six months.</p>
<p>She’s tried getting rid of the flying mammals, but the exterminator she consulted told her it would cost about $10,000 to complete the job.</p>
<p>“There’s no way I can afford to do it,” said Jackson, whose efforts to get government grants to help eliminate the bats have been rejected.</p>
<p>The bats are entering the house through gaps between the walls and roof, Jackson said. Usually, the nocturnal creatures stay in the attic, but more and more, particularly at nighttime, Jackson has noticed them squeezing their way into her kitchen, living room, bathroom and bedroom.</p>
<p>“I’ll see one flying around at least once a day,” she said.</p>
<p>One of the bats bit Jackson’s daughter, Ann Cumby, while she was staying at the house one night two years ago. Cumby was able to kill the bat with an iron, put it in a plastic bag and take it to the doctor’s office, where it tested negative for rabies.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean Jackson and her daughter are safe from the disease.</p>
<p>“Just because one bat tests negative for rabies doesn’t mean the others don’t have it,” Jacob Polsky, an environmentalist at the Bleckley County Health Department in Cochran, said. “It’s a huge risk to be living in a house like that.”</p>
<p>Polsky recommended that Jackson and her daughter receive rabies treatment if they continue staying at the home.</p>
<p>Jackson hasn’t been bitten by a bat yet — at least as far as she knows.</p>
<p>“It’s possible that she has been bitten in the middle of the night and never even knew it happened,” Polsky said.</p>
<p>Rabies isn’t the only health issue Jackson and her daughter have to worry about. Wade Green, an extension agent in nearby Twiggs County, said the mother and daughter are at risk for developing histoplasmosis, a serious respiratory disease caused by a fungus that grows on bat droppings.</p>
<p>“When people breathe in the air from bat droppings that have developed the fungus, they can get fever, chest pains or even develop a chronic lung disease,” Green said. “In the elderly, it could even become fatal.”</p>
<p>Jackson’s neighbors who breathe in the air are at risk, too, Green said.</p>
<p>Tyrone Elvine, who lives down the street from Jackson with his wife and kids, said he can smell the bats from sitting inside his house watching TV.</p>
<p>And Rose Coley, the 84-year-old who lives next door, said she’s scared the bats will make their way into her house next.</p>
<p>“I can smell them really strong, especially when a breeze blows through,” she said. “But what really scares me is the thought that one will come here and bite me.”</p>
<p>The bats can be heard chirping above the walls of the house almost constantly. Next-door neighbor Coley said the chirping noises the bats can grow so loud at times that it interferes with her sleeping.</p>
<p>The creatures can be seen flitting around inside through cracks in the roof, and bat droppings and carcasses blanket the edges of the house's foundation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Jackson’s daughter had a friend try to plug up the holes on the outside of the house where the bats have been entering, but so far, she’s been unsuccessful in her efforts to eradicate the creatures.</p>
<p>“It’s going to take a professional,” Cumby said. “And that’s something I just don’t think we can pay for right now.”</p>
<p>Truetech Pest and Animal Control is one local company that specializes in bat removal.</p>
<p>Michael Pope, who manages the company, said bat removals can cost anywhere from $200 to thousands of dollars, depending on the nature of the structure and the type of bats roosting there. Rather than traditional pest removals, bats have to be siphoned out of homes through special tubes and equipment.</p>
<p>“We’d be glad to come out Monday and give her a free inspection and see what we can do to help her from there,” Pope said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jackson said she and her daughter are still trying to save up enough money to get the bats removed.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a problem,” she said. ”Hopefully, we’ll be able to do something about it soon.”</p>

<p>New G.I. bill offers midstate veterans a full ride to Mercer, Wesleyan</p>
<p>By Carl Lewis</p>
<p>clewis@macon.com</p>
<p>Wednesday, Jul. 15, 2009</p>
<p>[/box]</p>
<p>From a young age, Elyse Jones wanted to be a dermatologist.</p>
<p>But when she was called to active duty with the Air Force in 2002, Jones, who was 19 at the time, almost gave up her plans to go to college.</p>
<p>“I put everything on hold, and I wasn’t sure of what would happen or if I’d be able to go to school in the future at all,” she said.</p>
<p><!--more-->Now, the 26-year-old may finally be getting the chance. Beginning next month, her classes at Wesleyan College should be covered under new benefits she earned from her military duty.</p>
<p>Jones is one of the many midstate service members who plans to reap the benefits of the new Post-9/11 GI Bill that takes effect in August.</p>
<p>Under the bill, a limited number of qualified Iraq and Afghanistan war-era veterans will be able to attend private colleges such as Mercer University and Wesleyan College for free or minimal tuition. And they will get expanded benefits at public institutions, too.</p>
<p>Dan Hines, a third-year Mercer law student, hopes to be one of the five students who will receive an additional $4,000 in financial assistance in the fall, half of which will come from federal coffers.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited about the prospect of this program,” said Hines, who served 13 months in Iraq and is president of the Mercer Law Military Veterans Association.</p>
<p>In the past, the federal government has helped pay for veterans’ tuition and fees at private colleges, but only up to an amount that matched the tuition at the most expensive public college in the state.</p>
<p>Yet at pricier private institutions such as Wesleyan and Mercer University, tuition exceeds that cap, which in the past has often forced service members either to make up the difference themselves or choose a public school instead.</p>
<p>However, under the Yellow Ribbon campaign — a component of the new bill — the government and participating private colleges will jointly cover the remaining difference to pay the entire tuition cost. At Mercer and Wesleyan in Macon, that means qualified veterans will receive a full scholarship.</p>
<p>According to information from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Mercer will contribute $11,625 per student, per year for 17 undergraduate students, while Wesleyan will contribute $8,750 for 10 students. Veterans Affairs will then match those amounts.</p>
<p>Mercer also has committed to covering the difference for at least 28 veterans to attend its graduate schools and regional academic centers and will contribute $2,000 in assistance to five veterans attending its law school.</p>
<p>A number of other veterans already have expressed interest in taking advantage of the program to attend Mercer, said Rick Goddard, who’s heading up the program at the school.</p>
<p>“These are veterans who may not necessarily have been able to afford Mercer without this assistance,” Goddard said. “And Mercer’s glad to have them. They bring a world of experience to the university, and the university feels an obligation to serve them.”</p>
<p>At least six veterans plan to attend Wesleyan in the fall using Yellow Ribbon money, Susan Welsh, a spokeswoman for the college, said.</p>
<p>At public colleges, veterans can expect to see enhanced benefits, too, though not as dramatic of improvements as their peers in private institutions are seeing.</p>
<p>In keeping with past GI bills, all qualified service members at state schools would still receive free tuition, but they now can transfer their benefits to family members more easily and may, in some cases, receive higher living stipends, said Tammie Burke, who handles VA programs at Georgia College &amp; State University.</p>
<p>But while the bill does provide some new advantages to students at state colleges, it’s not expected to be a major change.</p>
<p>“At GCSU, it’s going to improve the way in which student veterans receive benefits, but it’s not really going to affect the amount of benefits they receive,” Burke said.</p>
<p>Officials at Macon State College and Fort Valley State University echoed Burke’s sentiments, saying that while the bill is a great improvement, it should not cause any major influx in veteran enrollment.</p>
<p>The new bill does have stipulations. To qualify for full assistance, veterans must have served at least 36 months for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Waugh said. Other service — such as Homeland Security missions or participation in the Active Guard and Reserve Program — may not qualify for benefits under the bill.</p>
<p>As for Jones, she’s getting the chance to attend a school she might not have been able to afford otherwise.</p>
<p>“I love the small, private setting of Wesleyan,” she said. “It gives me opportunities I might not have gotten at a big state school.”</p>

<p>Annual Macon butterfly count keeps tabs on ecosystem</p>

<p>[su_dropcap style="simple" size="3"]T[/su_dropcap]he van rumbled along the damp clay road as Andy Rindsberg narrowed his eyes upon the thicket of verbena and kudzu scattered underneath the Georgia Power lines.</p>
<p>The vehicle screeched to a halt. Rindsberg grasped his camera, binoculars and field guide and leapt out of the car.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” he exclaimed, gesturing at what appeared to be a clump of average roadside weeds.</p>
<p><!--more-->Nearly invisible to the naked eye sat a tiny, drab, mostly brown butterfly atop the leaf of a buttonbush.</p>
<p>“It’s so ornate,” Rinsberg said as he squinted into his binoculars. “It’s a Creole Pearly Eye. I’ve never seen one of those before.”</p>
<p>Rindsberg was one of eight volunteers who joined wildlife officials Monday for Macon’s annual butterfly count. Participants split into groups and counted as many different butterfly species as they could in one day to keep track of population trends.</p>
<p>The count surveyed a 7.5 mile radius, including parts of Bond Swamp, the Ocmulgee National Monument and Central City Park.</p>
<p>Early in the day, volunteers had a difficult time finding butterflies because of the drizzly wet weather.</p>
<p>“The butterflies don’t like to move around much when it’s rainy like this,” said Tim Keyes, a wildlife biologist with the Department of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>At 11:30 in the morning, after walking down the banks of the Ocmulgee River for about two hours, a group of butterfly counters at Bonds View Road had only found 10 species.</p>
<p>“It’s really kind of dead right now,” Keyes said.</p>
<p>Just as volunteers prepared to retire for lunch, however, the sun emerged from behind the storm clouds and butterflies began to whiz around.</p>
<p>Keyes and his crew put off lunch until 1:30 p.m. because they kept finding more butterflies.</p>
<p>They found yellow Fiery Skippers flitting near the sycamore trees on the river’s banks, Red Admirals darting across the pathway and stately Hackberry Emperors sipping on the puddles in the road.</p>
<p>“The male butterflies like to have puddle parties right after a big rain. They’ll come out and drink up the water and take it back to the females,” said Rindsberg, who is a professor at the University of West Alabama.</p>
<p>By early afternoon, the group had counted 28 different species, but Keyes said he expected at least 40 species to be identified by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Identifying butterflies can be a cumbersome task, Keyes said. Usually, the two winged-insects zip by so quickly that a bystander isn’t able to get a good look at them.</p>
<p>To make the process easier, volunteers brought cameras to snap pictures of the butterflies before they flew into the bushes.</p>
<p>“Some of them are just naturally shy but others are paparazzi hogs and love to be photographed,” Rindsberg joked. “But, always, the first thing I do is try to get a picture.”</p>
<p>Once Rinsberg captures a photo on his digital camera screen, he can almost always identify which one of Georgia’s more than 120 native butterfly species the specimen belongs to within a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>“It’s really not that hard to do. Anyone can do it if they spent a few days studying (butterflies),” he said.</p>
<p>Rinsberg said butterfly counts are important not only because they keep tabs on how butterflies are doing, but because they indicate the health of the ecosystem as a whole. “We absolutely must keep doing these counts, because they’re the first warning sign if something bad is about to happen,” he said.</p>
<p>To volunteer to be a butterfly counter in next year’s count, call the Department of Natural Resources office in Macon at 994-1438 or visit the Web site of the North American Butterfly Association at www.naba.org.</p>
