<p>Georgia College Foundation hopes to save home of pioneering black educator</p>
<p>By Carl Lewis</p>
<p>clewis@macon.com</p>
<p>Thursday, Jun. 25, 2009</p>
<p>[/box]</p>
<p>MILLEDGEVILLE — Fifteen-year-old Deandre Hooks crouched on the porch of a crumbling, wood-planked house Wednesday morning to complete a writing assignment.</p>
<p>The house was nothing special and the heat was blistering, but it didn’t seem to bother him. In fact, he felt perfectly at home.</p>
<p><!--more-->“I’m meant to be here right now,” Hooks said. “It’s part of who I am.”</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="MA_01A2" src="/assets/MA_01A2.jpg" alt="MA_01A2" width="161" height="318" /></p>
<p>It’s the same porch that black students like Hooks sat on 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Back then, the four-bedroom house on Clarke Street belonged to Sallie Ellis Davis, one of the first black educators in Georgia. Davis often mentored students at the house, which she lived in until her death in 1950.</p>
<p>But for many years, the historic home has been left to decay.</p>
<p>Now, officials from Georgia College &amp; State University and the Sallie Ellis Davis Foundation are trying to raise money to renovate the house and open it as an African-American cultural center.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Georgia Trust added the Davis house to its “Places in Peril” list because of the structure’s deteriorating condition.</p>
<p>“This is an important piece of African-American history that we desperately need to preserve,” Judy Bailey, a spokeswoman for the college, said.</p>
<p>Bailey said it will cost an estimated $380,000 to renovate the home and $25,000 to stabilize it. So far, the foundation has raised about $15,000.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for all the help we can get. We’ve got a long way to go, but we have to make sure we’re able to save this place,” Bailey said.</p>
<p>Davis was born in Milledgeville in 1877 to a black mother and an Irish father, Bailey said.</p>
<p>She attended the Eddy School, where she later served as teacher and principal for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>Her house, which was built in 1890, changed hands numerous times before Georgia College purchased it in 1989.</p>
<p>Bailey said she hopes the Davis house will inspire people to follow after Sallie’s legacy and enter the field of education.</p>
<p>“Sallie Davis educated black students during a period of time when they didn’t have access to education. Hopefully, this house will motivate people to become educators themselves,” she said.</p>
<p>Camille Tyson is the principal of Early College, a school for students in seventh through 12th grades that holds classes at Georgia College. Tyson took her students to see the Davis home Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Either you can be a pioneer or a settler,” Tyson said. “Sallie Ellis Davis was a pioneer, and these students can be pioneers, too. That’s what I want them to realize.”</p>
<p>Hooks, who is a 10th-grader at Early College, said Davis’ story has inspired him to pursue a more ambitious future.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go to college and be a professional when I grow up. (Davis) spent her entire life trying to make sure our ancestors could do that, and I don’t want to let her down,” he said.</p>

<p>Macon Mall turns to arts, entertainment to fill empty space</p>
<p>By Carl Lewis</p>
<p>clewis@macon.com</p>
<p>Thursday, Jun. 18, 2009</p>
<p>Instead of showcasing his art in a downtown gallery like other artists, Michael Paul has chosen a different, less obvious place to share his work: the Macon Mall.</p>
<p>Paul is taking part in a new program called Artspace, which, along with a laser golf course, is one of the mall’s recent efforts to help reinvent itself.</p>
<p><!--more-->The mall will offer 18 of its vacant stores in the east wing to artists, who can then transform the space into galleries, studios and offices. Three artists already have been recruited to display their work at the mall.</p>
<p>Mall manager Brian Olivi said he hopes the program will attract more people, increasing foot traffic and hopefully increasing sales for other mall retailers.</p>
<p>“We want to make the mall an art destination, to make it a fully functioning art colony for Middle Georgia with artists working on and showcasing their work around the clock,” Olivi said.</p>
<p>The idea for the program came from a sister mall in St. Louis, Olivi said. That mall was able to fill 45 empty stores with paintings, sculptures and dance studios.</p>
<p>“It’s a ‘win-win’ situation for everybody,” Olivi said. “It helps retailers, it helps artists and it even helps the community by providing a place to view local artwork,” Olivi said.</p>
<p>As part of the program, artists will receive discounted rent, flexible lease terms and 24/7 access to their spaces.</p>
<p>Paul said the mall is a perfect place for him because, unlike other galleries, it allows him to keep 100 percent of the profits from his paintings rather than being charged a portion of the sale.</p>
<p>“I’ve considered putting my art in some of the galleries downtown, but this makes a lot more financial sense,” Paul said.</p>
<p>Another benefit of locating at the mall, he said, is that it makes his artwork accessible to people who wouldn’t normally get the chance to see it.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, people who wouldn’t necessarily go to a downtown art gallery but who would go to Macy’s or Sears on Eisenhower Parkway will see my art and get inspired,” Paul said.</p>
<p>Artspace is not the mall’s only effort to increase its traffic. In April, the mall recruited Lunar Mini Golf, a laser putt-putt company out of Akron, Ohio, to open a location in the second level of the east wing, near the former Dillard’s. Olivi said the business has already brought a new demographic to the mall.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen so many parents bring their kids there that the (Lunar Mini Golf) course is now our No. 1 store in the whole mall,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the traffic from the laser golf course and other retailers, Macon Mall may not have an easy time getting artists to invest in the program.</p>
<p>The 1.4 million-square-foot shopping center has at least 40 vacant storefronts and its sale is pending after going into foreclosure last July.</p>
<p>In 2007, Parisian, a 104,000-square-foot department store, closed its location in the mall. A year later, Dillard’s, another anchor store, relocated to the Shoppes at River Crossing, an outdoor shopping center in north Bibb County.</p>
<p>Macon Mall’s current management company, Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle Americas Inc., is “constantly out trying to attract new tenants,” Olivi said.</p>
<p>But in the past year, more than 35 stores have left the mall, according to the mall’s June 2008 directory compared with the June 2009 directory.</p>
<p>Some of the stores that have closed include Gap, Old Navy, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Eddie Bauer, Lane Bryant, Wolf Camera, Starbucks, Piccadilly Cafeteria and Ruby Tuesday.</p>
<p>Last January, Dallas, Texas-based Movie Tavern Partners LP announced plans to open a 35,000-square-foot dinner theater in a portion of the former Parisian store, but after further consideration, backed out of plans for the location.</p>
<p>“The initial plans for the theater didn’t turn out to be cost-effective, so the ownership decided to table the project and look elsewhere,” Olivi said.</p>
<p>Olivi maintains, however, that Macon Mall still has the ability to attract new tenants in the future, especially if the condition of the national economy continues to improve.</p>
<p>“Last year alone, the mall had 13 million visits from a 22-county area. We are still the premier shopping center of Middle Georgia, and our losses have been mostly because of the national recession,” he said.</p>
<p>Olivi said the mall houses the only Macy’s department store in the region and that a new Verizon Wireless store just opened in the shopping center this month.</p>
<p>Melissa Goff, a spokeswoman for Macy’s, said the company has no plans to close its store in Macon Mall at the current time.</p>
<p>Unlike other retailers at the mall who lease their space, Macy’s owns the property where its store is located. At least seven of the mall’s retailers have duplicate stores at The Shoppes at River Crossing, including Aeropostale, American Eagle, Belk and Sunglass Hut.</p>
<p>Olivi said he is not worried that The Shoppes will replace the mall anytime soon.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to spend two or three hours outdoors in the summer heat shopping there. Here at Macon Mall, it’s 72 degrees year-round,” he said.</p>

<p>Opening event a big draw at Georgia Peach Festival</p>
<p><em>The Sun News</em></p>
<p>By Carl Lewis</p>
<p>clewis@macon.com</p>
<p>Wednesday, Jun. 17, 2009</p>

<p>Ask Andrew Mathis to name his favorite food and he’ll tell you in an instant.</p>
<p>“It’s peaches, no question,” he said.</p>
<p>Mathis, a 70-year-old from Fort Valley, worked at a peach farm earlier in life and hasn’t missed a single Georgia Peach Festival since the event was launched in 1986.</p>
<p><!--more-->Saturday, he made it out once again to the festival’s annual kickoff celebration at the Peach Shops of Byron.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t miss it for anything,” he said.</p>
<p>The celebration began at 5 p.m. and featured live music, arts and crafts vendors, a fireworks show and a foam party for the kids.</p>
<p>Festival director Rich Bennett said it was the biggest crowd he’s ever seen for the celebration.</p>
<p>Brandi Trivette, a vendor at the event who sells peach-scented candles she makes at her home in Warner Robins, said the crowd was good for business.</p>
<p>“The peach candle has been a real hit tonight. People here in Peach County sure do love their peaches,” Trivette said.</p>
<p>But for some people, such as Janet Wynne and her husband, David, this year’s Peach Festival isn’t just about the titular fruit.</p>
<p>“Peaches are great, but we’re more into motorcycles, which is why we’re here,” she said.</p>
<p>Wynne said she had never been to the Peach Festival before until she rode in the festival’s first Poker Run Saturday morning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wynne’s 3-year-old daughter, Erika, said she loved the foam party.</p>
<p>“It looks like snow,” she said.</p>
<p>J.B. Roberson, an author from Warner Robins, was at the celebration signing copies of her latest children’s book, “Cuddlee Bugs: Revenge o’ the Peach Potion.”</p>
<p>“It’s a book that’s actually a lot about the Peach Festival,” she said.</p>
<p>The bands 2 Finger Jester and The Skeeterz performed free shows during the celebration.</p>
<p>“I was a little worried Two Finger Jester might be too loud for the festival, but everybody seemed to love them,” Bennett said. Mathis, however, said he was holding out for The Skeeterz, a more traditional country band.</p>
<p>“I may be old, but I love to dance when they play my sort of music,” he said.</p>
<p>The festival concluded with a fireworks display shot off from behind the shopping center.</p>
<p>“The fireworks are always the best part,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>As the kickoff to the festival drew to a close, Bennett said he held high hopes for the rest of it.</p>
<p>“This is looking like it might be one of the best Peach festivals yet. We’ve already gotten more involvement than last year,” he said.</p>

<p>Annual Juneteenth festival celebrates liberation, educates about struggles of slavery.</p>

<p>Four years ago, Nduta Mwangi, 39, lived in a small tenement apartment in Kenya, where she and her sisters sewed traditional African dresses for a living.</p>
<p>Saturday, she brought those dresses to Macon and put them on sale at the annual Juneteenth Freedom Festival at Tattnall Square Park.</p>
<p><!--more-->“These dresses represent who I am and who we as African-Americans are. It’s our living symbolic legacy,” she said.</p>
<p>The festival was a daylong celebration of Juneteenth, the holiday which commemorates the liberation of slaves in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865.</p>
<p>“It’s sort of like an African-American Independence Day,” said Michelle Fitz, a festival organizer.</p>
<p>But Fitz said that Juneteenth isn’t just for African-Americans.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to educate people of all races about the struggles of slavery. So many people have no idea or they forget what our people went through,” she said.</p>
<p>The festival featured live jazz music, arts and crafts vendors and educational presentations.</p>
<p>Festival director George Muhammad said he expected as many as 1,000 people to attend the festival by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Baatin Muhammad, a member of the Middle Georgia Jazz Allstar Band, said the festival is one of the band’s best opportunities to play yet.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited to play at this event in particular because of what it means to us. It means freedom. It means liberty. It means everything jazz music is supposed to be about,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the festival highlights was a Civil War era re-enactment that demonstrated the black freedom struggle.</p>
<p>Clifford Price, who’s been putting on the re-enactment in his spare time for the past 22 years, said his lifelong mission is to teach people to appreciate the hardships faced by black Union soldiers.</p>
<p>“We want to teach people what our ancestors did during the Civil War, about how they gave up their lives for that elusive word called freedom,” Price said.</p>
<p>James Simpson, a 49-year-old from Macon, has been bringing his wife and five kids to the festival for as long as he can remember.</p>
<p>“We come every year with lawn chairs and a cooler of sodas and stay all day. It’s not only fun, but it’s a great way to teach my kids something,” he said.</p>
<p>Simpson said he was particularly impressed with the variety of merchandise being sold at this year’s festival.</p>
<p>“I just got me a brand new yard hat,” he said.</p>
<p>Ankur Patel, a junior at Mercer University, said he heard the music from the festival as he was walking down College Street and decided to see what the event was all about.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty amazing to hear all this history. Even though I’m not black, I can appreciate it. It’s important that we all support events like this that teach people history and will change the way they look at things today,” he said.</p>
