        Kingsbridge neighborhood undergoes Jewish revival

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">[dropcap]J[/dropcap]oseph Feinberg tapped away at his cell phone as he crossed the bustling intersection that serves as the centerpiece for the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. His slim-fit trousers were black like his hair and his unkempt sideburns. He wore a tiny woo<strong>l </strong>yarmulke on his head.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><img title="More..." src="/assets/trans.gif" alt="" />As he stepped into the front doors of the new kosher bakery on 231st Street, Feinberg, 23, said he was well aware that he stuck out in the predominantly elderly, Dominican and African-American neighborhood.</p>
<p>“You usually don’t too see many young Jews like me hanging out around here,” said Feinberg, who lives 15 minutes up the hill in Riverdale but has recently begun driving down to Kingsbridge to get coffee, check his email and eat lunch at the bakery because he likes the falafels. “I guess that makes me a trendsetter.”</p>
<p>A new wave of gentrification in the area near 231st Street west of Broadway has begun to breath fresh life into Kingsbridge’s long-declining Jewish community, and may signal a possible reversal to the nearly four decade long trend of Jews leaving the neighborhood for more affluent, outlying suburban areas.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 2002 alone, the number of people living in Jewish households in the Bronx plunged from 90,000 to 54,300, according to estimates from the UJA-Federation’s Jewish Community Survey. That’s a more than 40 percent decline.</p>
<p>In Kingsbridge, Jewish community leaders have long feared that the neighborhood could soon lose what’s left of its long-dwindling Jewish population, and suffer a fate similar to that of countless other neighborhoods across the Bronx that have been forced to close their last synagogues.</p>
<p>“For a while there, it looked like we wouldn’t have much of a Jewish population anymore in Kingsbridge at all,” said 67-year-old Jason Rosenberger, an Orthodox Jew who has lived in the neighborhood for most of his life. “The younger Jews were moving away to start families, and the older ones were dying out.”</p>
<p>But at the Kingsbridge Center of Israel. the neighborhood’s only remaining synagogue, membership and attendance are on the rise for the first time in nearly 20 years. Around 60 worshippers gathered at a recent Saturday service at the Modern Orthodox synagogue on Corlear Avenue, up from an all-time-low of 15 people per week two years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just around the corner on 231st Street, two new kosher delis and a bagel shop have opened up in the span of the last three years alone, establishing a solid stock of Jewish-owned eateries in a neighborhood where it might previously have been a stretch to find a falafel.</p>
<p>“It’s like a new little Jewish renaissance popping up here in Kingbsridge,” Rabbi David Jonas at the Kingsbridge Center of Israel said. “It’s been an explosion.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly how many Jewish residents may have recently relocated to Kingsbridge, or how many might be simply spending more time there, since the U.S. Census does not track religious affiliations.</p>
<p>But the recent flurry of construction projects in the 231st Street area –– including two new luxury condominium buildings, the recently constructed Kingsbridge Public Library and the new TD Bank branch at the corner of Corlear Avenue –– suggest the neighborhood may have enough steam to keep attracting more young Jews and new residents in general.</p>
<p>Developers said the neighborhood’s proximity to new retail shopping and the recently renovated Kingsdbridge subway station, along with its low cost of rent and closer access to the city make Kingsbridge an attractive new place for younger residents to live.</p>
<p>“Kingsbridge is the place people are picking these days to live comfortably for less, especially young families,” said Rutherford Thompson, a managing director at Jackson Capital Partners Corp., the sales and leasing agent for Sycamore Court Condominium, a 63-unit building that opened recently at the corner of 231st and Corlear Avenue. “Almost half our interested buyers have been families who are new to the area. It’s unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Just across the street from Sycamore, construction for the Pancas condo building at 3120 Corlear was recently completed. The building will house a charter school on the first three floors and 48 condos in the top seven floors.</p>
<p>The new living spaces and charter school will help solve two longstanding barriers to Kingsbridge’s revitalization by increasing the available stock of spacious family-sized housing units and giving parents another option of where to send their children to school, Thompson said.</p>
<p>“The one thing that’s been holding up people from coming here is that there hasn’t been enough of the type of housing available that would accomodate a new family with the potential for growth,” Thompson said. “The new condominiums should solve that, and bring a better range of schools to the neighborhood as well.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong> A RETURN TO ROOTS</strong></p>
<p>[dropcap]A[/dropcap]s the oldest living member of Kingsbridge’s synagogue, Sol Lieman, 86, has witnessed the changing demographic patterns of Jewish residents in Kingsbridge and the Bronx for nearly five decades.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignright" width="447" caption="Sol Lieman, 86, walks the halls of the Kingsbridge Center of Israel, where he is the oldest living member. (CARL V. LEWIS/The Bronx Ink)"]<img class="     " title="kbridge2" src="/assets/DSC_0624.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="296" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Lieman first moved with his wife and kids to Kingbsridge in 1963, making them one of the last young Jewish families to settle in the neighborhood during what he calls "the boom period". When the Liemans first started attending the synagogue, around 500 members would often come out for regular weekly services, Lieman said.</p>
<p>“I had assumed other Jewish families with kids would be following us, but they didn’t,” said Lieman, who is now the only Jew left in his Riverdale Avenue apartment building located four blocks from the Kingsbridge synangogue. “The other Jews here went elsewhere, and we were steadily pushed into the minority.”</p>
<p>In 1948, there were more Jews in the Bronx — 650,000 — than in the entire State of Israel. By 2003, just 45,000 were left in the entire borough, according to the most recent Jewish Community Study conducted in 2002 by UJA-Federation.</p>
<p>In keeping with the broader middle-class population at the time, Jews in Kingsbridge began moving primarily to Riverdale as well as outlying suburban areas in the 1970s and ‘80s as a way to claim their own turf on the outskirts of the city and escape the onslaught of low-rent occupants and slumlords in the south Bronx.</p>
<p>But experts said the division between Riverdale and Kingsbridge may have less to do with geography and more to do with the development of cultural stereotypes.</p>
<p>At Yeshiva University, Jeffrey S. Gurock, of Riverdale, is a professor of Jewish history. Grurock said the rapid movement of Jews up the hill from Kingsbridge into Riverdale during the late ‘60s, ‘70s and ‘80s eventually gave rise to an imaginary geographic boundary based on the shape of the hill itself.</p>
<p>“What pervaded was this sense that Riverdale was the land of  liberal, open-minded, middle-class families, while Kingsbridge, despite being just a five minute walk down the hill, was a place where elderly Jews were slowly being encroached upon by various other minority populations,” Gurock said.</p>
<p>Gurock said that because Jews chose to stay in Riverdale for the coming decades they developed a “sense of turf” about the place, making it less likely they would relocate elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Kingsbridge never had the cachet of Riverdale, and it still doesn’t today. That imaginary border between the two neighborhoods has grown so strong over the years that it would now be almost impossible to undo,” Gurock said.</p>
<p>But for the 86-year-old Lieman’s two adult sons,  who both live on 96th Street in Manhattan, the imaginary divide between Kingsbridge and Riverdale may already be beginning to crumble. The two brothers had planned on moving to Riverdale in the early part of next year, but recently decided to look for an apartment in Kingsbridge instead.</p>
<p>“I think there will be a lot more people like them who start realizing soon that they can live in Kingsbridge with the same amenities as Riverdale or Manhattan but for half the price,” Lieman said. “I think it’s already happening.”</p>
<p>Across the street from the synagogue on Corlear Avenue, a turn-of-the-century single family home was recently restored to make room for new tenants.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>BACK DOWN THE HILL</strong></p>
<p>[dropcap]A [/dropcap]shiny new blue metal sign was erected six months ago outside the Kingsbridge Center of Israel as a way to remind people that the synagogue is doing well these days. A message on the synagogue’s website reads ‘COME SEE WHAT ALL THE BUZZ IS ABOUT.’</p>
<p>Rabbi Jonas, 25, is the youngest rabbi to lead the Kingsbridge Center of Israel since the synagogue was founded in 1934. When former shul leaders nearly closed the synagogue two years ago in response record-low attendance and financial problems, Jonas stepped in as the church’s new Rabbi to see if he could possibly turn things around.</p>
<p>“When I came in as Rabbi, the synagogue had been running straight in the red for almost 20 years,” Jonas said. “Luckily, we finally managed to break even last year.”</p>
<p>Although Jonas said he does deserve some credit for getting the synagogue back on solid financial ground, he attributed the bulk of the synagogue’s recent success to changing perceptions about the Kingbsridge neighborhood taking place within the Bronx’s Jewish community.</p>
<p>“All the new development happening in the area is causing people to reconsider all the stereotypes they were taught about Kingsbridge when they were growing up,” Jonas said. “That warning that all our parents gave us ‘not go down the hill’ is starting to lose its effect.”</p>
<p>Jonas and his wife Natalie have yet to move down the hill to Kingsbridge themselves, but Jonas said they have considered making the move eventually.</p>
<p>Like Jonas, many of the synangogue’s new members actually live in Central Riverdale and have chosen to start attending the lone Kingsbridge shul rather than any one of the nine Jewish congregations in Riverdale.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit more of an intimate feel here, and now that Kingsbridge has started to turn around as an entire area, Jewish families from up the hill are more open to making the commute to join us here,” Jonas said.</p>
<p>Moshe Zachs, a Jewish small business owner who lives just on the other side of Riverdale Avenue, opened Cafecino, a kosher bakery, deli and coffee shop, on 231st Street in Kingsbridge earlier this year.</p>
<p>Zachs, 52, said he’s seen a steady flow of business at the bakery since it opened in January, with Jews from Riverdale coming to the shop either as a destination for kosher food items, or as a quick stop on the one-train during their daily commute.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure any of the Jews from Riverdale are actually spending much time here yet, but I’m sure they will in time if the neighborhood keeps improving,” Zachs said. “That’s why I’m here.”</p>
<p>Younger generations of Jewish residents Kingsbridge said they may also feel more compelled to stay in Kingsbridge to raise a family one day if the revitalization trend continues.</p>
<p>Jake Dorfman, 21, lives a block away from the Kingsbridge Center of Israel on Tibbett Avenue. He said he’s noticed that his Jewish friends from Riverdale have become increasingly more open to the idea of walking down the street in Kingsbridge alone at night.</p>
<p>“Kingsbridge is getting safer and nicer all the time,” Dorfman said. “To me, it’s like a new and improved Washington Heights. I think it’s only a matter of time before people outside the community start picking up on Kingsbridge and realizing what’s going on, then you’ll see peple moving here almost overnight.”</p>
<p>But Dorfman said he’s in no hurry for the crowds to arrive. He enjoys the pizza at Cafeccino Bakerty too much to start having to wait in line for it with others.</p>
<p>“It’s fantastic pizza, really,” Dorfman said. “It’s the kind of pizza that would make you  say, ‘Hey, I want to move my family here and live forever’.”</p>

        The Bullet-Dodging Priest of the North Bronx
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2011</span>

    <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/the-bullet-dodging-priest/"><img class=" wp-image-2177 " title="halflife_density-1" src="/assets/revjenik1.jpeg" alt="" width="393" height="225" /></a>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Originally <a href="http://bronxink.org/2011/11/11/19562-the-bullet-dodging-priest/">appeared</a> on BronxInk.org on Aug. 11, 2011.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rev. John Jenik stepped out of the front door of his office on East 196th Street around mid-afternoon. Kids in red and gray school uniforms played in the street. Young mothers pushed strollers along the sidewalk. Vendors were selling shaved ices to passersby.</p>
<p>As he turned the corner onto Briggs Avenue, Jenik walked past a row of old Victorian-style houses.</p>
<p>“This is where the drug dealers have been selling heroin lately, and they probably are doing it right now,” the silver-haired Jenik said as he peered out from underneath a baseball cap at the street adjacent to P.S. 46. “Right here, all within feet of these kids.”</p>
<p>Jenik, 67, is the pastor at Our Lady of Refuge Church and School in the north Bronx. Over the past three decades, he’s watched his parish slip into the throes of drug and substance abuse at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>“When I first got here in 1978, drugs weren’t much of a problem, but ever since the early ’80s when the crack epidemic hit, it’s been awful,” said Jenik. “It’s ruining our community, one life at a time.”</p>
<p>What bothers Jenik most about the open-air drug dealing near Our Lady of Refuge Church is how close the criminal activity is to the nearly 1,500 school children who attend both the parochial school onsite and P.S. 46 across East 196th Street.</p>
<p>Jenik said drug trafficking in the neighborhood has become so prevalent that dealers have taken to peddling their goods in the lobbies of residential buildings, schoolyards and – on one occasion four years ago – even in the sanctuary of his church.</p>
<p>“I called it the abomination of abominations,” Jenik said. “Breaking into a church during Mass to sell drugs. It was despicable,” Jenik said.</p>
<p>Jenik said it’s taken more than prayer to combat the drug problem. He has organized marches, vigils and public outreach campaigns to protest illegal drug use. He has even worked with the 52nd Precinct to try and bring the local drug dealers to justice by helping conduct regular patrols of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But Jenik admitted that his efforts to curb illegal drug use have fallen short so far.</p>
<p>“People just haven’t really responded to our message,” Jenik said. “Drugs are still all over the place in this neighborhood. You can see it in people’s eyes, in their noses.”</p>
<p>Jenik said he is skeptical of NYPD statistics that claim overall crime rates have dropped in the neighborhood  by 30 percent in the last decade.</p>
<p>“Those numbers are for the whole precinct, and don’t necessarily reflect what’s happening in our community specifically,” Jenik said. “Plus the police don’t even try to prosecute drug dealers anymore because they lack the resources.”</p>
<p>Despite the fact that substance abuse continues to ravage the neighborhood, community leaders say Jenik's crusades have prevented the problem from becoming even worse than it might have otherwise.</p>
<p>At the nearby Fordham-Bedford Housing Association, executive director John Reilly said that without leaders like Jenik, the neighborhoods of Norwood and Fordham may have ended up experiencing poverty problems more like those in the south Bronx.</p>
<p>“You would have likely seen a lot more people moving out of this neighborhood to other places if not for the work of Father Jenik,” Reilly said.</p>
<p>Around the area of 196th Street and Bainbridge Avenue, Jenik’s crusade against illegal drug use has propelled him to an almost legendary status – often for better, sometimes for worse.</p>
<p>Gunshots were fired into the window of Jenik’s apartment one evening two years ago after he led an anti-drug march across the community. The gunman was never caught.</p>
<p>“The shooting was a real wake-up call for me that I needed to be more careful. I now make sure to keep my blinds down at night,” Jenik said.</p>
<p>Jenik said he also owns two bulletproof vests that he wears whenever he feels unsafe.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the church’s more than 1,500 members have offered Jenik a lifeline of support, and a gang of his own for protection.</p>
<p>Back on Briggs Avenue, an elderly Hispanic woman greeted Jenik with a smile and a friendly gesture. On 197th Street, a teenage boy pulled Jenik aside on the street to say, “Hi Father, how are you?”</p>
<p>Lillian Roig, the church’s secretary, said Jenik’s commitment to improving the community has inspired her and others in the congregation to pitch in and help fight local drug addiction as well.</p>
<p>“Father Jenik has always looked out for me and for all of the people in the community, especially the poor,” Roig said. “He doesn’t advertise what he does, but he’s one of the most genuine people I’ve ever met.”</p>
<p>On a recent Sunday evening, a Spanish-language chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous gathered for its weekly support meeting in the church social hall, which Jenik lets the group use whenever it wants. Jenik said furnishing the group with a place to meet is one of the many ways he and his congregation are trying to clean up his community, even if they can’t completely stamp out the illegal drug trade altogether.</p>
<p>“This isn’t to convert or proselytize people in my eyes,” Jenik said. “It’s  just self-interest. Nobody wants to live and attend church in a community filled with addicts, much less send their kids to school there.”</p>

        Opt-in tax credits give boon to midstate private schools.

<p><em>The Telegraph</em>/Macon.com</p>
<p>Originally <a href="http://www.macon.com/2010/08/07/1221132/opt-in-tax-credits-give-midstate.html">appeared</a> Aug. 7, 2010</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://carlvlewis.net/opt-in-tax-credits-give-boon-to-midstate-private-schools/"><img class=" wp-image-2177 " title="halflife_density-1" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2012-04-01-at-4.13.58-PM.png" alt=""  /></a>
<p>Donna Drummond’s family members pay part of their state income taxes to an unusual place: her 6-year-old daughter’s private K-12 school.</p>
<p><img title="More..." src="/assets/trans.gif" alt="" />Drummond’s daughter Laney is attending The Westfield School in Perry this fall using scholarship money from an opt-in taxpayer-funded scholarship program.</p>
<p>At least 254 other midstate students like Laney are receiving a free or reduced price private school education this fall, adding up to about $750,000 in scholarships in Middle Georgia alone, according to information from Georgia GOAL, the scholarship organization administering most of the money.</p>
<p>As part of a law passed by Gov. Sonny Perdue in 2008 and just now gaining popularity, taxpayers can redirect state income taxes to one of 29 independent scholarship organizations approved by the Georgia Department of Education.</p>
<p>A couple can redirect up to $2,500 in state income tax payments annually to their chosen scholarship organization, and an individual can redirect up to $1,000.</p>
<p>After redirecting the money to one of the scholarship organizations, individuals don’t choose which students receive scholarships — that’s up to the scholarship organizations — but they can choose what private school they want their money to be donated to.</p>
<p>Under the law, up to $50 million in income tax payments can be redirected toward private-school scholarships statewide each year.</p>
<p>...</p>
<h2><strong>Boon to midstate private schools</strong></h2>
<p>The scholarships — which are available only to students transferring from a public school or entering kindergarten — have allowed private schools in the area to recruit new students and keep enrollments steady despite the slack economy.</p>
<p>Most Middle Georgia private schools are participating this fall in Georgia GOAL, the largest of the approved scholarship organizations. Mount de Sales Academy, in Macon, participates in a different approved scholarship organization, GRACE Scholars, which is specifically designed for Catholic schools.</p>
<p>The GOAL and GRACE programs, which both administer need-based scholarships, have helped midstate private schools enroll new low-income students whose parents wouldn’t normally be able to afford a private education.</p>
<p>Officials at First Presbyterian Day School, Stratford Academy, Tattnall Square Academy, Mount de Sales Academy and The Westfield School said they have all either met or exceeded predicted enrollment figures and expect stable operating budgets this fall.</p>
<p>At Stratford, Headmaster Bob Veto said he’s expecting about 940 students roaming the halls when classes begin Aug. 17. That’s up significantly from the 914 students enrolled last year.</p>
<p>“There’s no question this increase in enrollment is directly tied to the GOAL scholarship, which has allowed a lot of new families to send their kids here,” Veto said.</p>
<p>Veto said the GOAL program has boosted Stratford’s financial aid budget by more than $100,000 this year. The growth in enrollment has allowed Stratford to add new computer labs and four new employees this fall.</p>
<p>At First Presbyterian Day School, Headmaster Gregg Thompson told a similar story. Thompson said he’s expecting 971 students this fall, which is up from last year because of the more than $100,000 extra the school has on hand to dole out GOAL scholarships.</p>
<p>“I think people like the idea of being able to direct the way their taxes are spent, and I know we’ve gotten a lot of people directing it toward us,” Thompson said. “We’re not making cuts at FPD like you’re seeing at some of the public schools.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<h2><strong>Statewide effects</strong></h2>
<p>Lisa Kelly, president of the GOAL scholarship program, said the organization is planning to administer a total of $6.5 million in need-based aid to about 1,700 students statewide this fall.</p>
<p>Directing money toward GOAL or any of the other approved scholarship organizations is considered a tax credit, not a tax write-off, which means that 100 percent of the money donated is slashed from the individual’s state income taxes, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Kelly said families seeking to receive scholarships from the GOAL program must demonstrate financial need based on roughly the same criteria that’s necessary to receive free or reduced lunches at public schools.</p>
<p>But GOAL is just one of the many approved scholarship organizations, and there’s nothing in the law mandating that household income be a consideration of other organizations.</p>
<p>“At GOAL, we have very clear guidelines and income requirements for all students who we give scholarships to, and we’re aiming to be transparent, but there’s nothing requiring us do that. I’m concerned that some of the other scholarship organizations could possibly take advantage of this law and give tax-funded scholarships to kids who don’t need it as badly as others,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Kelly said she thinks the law needs to be strengthened to allow for more oversight and to require scholarship organizations to be more transparent.</p>
<p>Jennifer Hackemeyer, chief counsel with the Georgia Department of Education, said the Department of Education only has the power either to approve or reject scholarship organizations based upon whether they meet the tax-exempt qualifications.</p>
<p>“The way the law is written, there’s very little oversight on our part. The (scholarship organizations) basically just have to show us that they’re registered. If someone has a concern that the law isn’t strong enough, they should take that up with the legislators,” Hackemeyer said.</p>
<p>Hackemeyer said there’s not really a good way of telling how much total scholarship money has been given out statewide — or what qualifications the scholarship organizations use — since they all operate autonomously of each other.</p>
<p>But for Drummond, a single Fort Valley mother, the important part is that her daughter has been given an opportunity previously out of reach.</p>
<p>“This has been such a huge, huge blessing. I never thought I’d get to send my daughter to a Christian school where she’d also be stimulated intellectually, and I couldn’t have done it without this money.”</p>

<p>One of Mercer’s two student trolleys inexplicably burst into flames early Friday morning just moments after dropping off its last load of passengers at Greek Village.</p>
<p>The driver of the iconic “Miss Molly” trolley was traveling north on Stadium Drive near the University Center around 3:30 a.m. when he noticed smoke coming from the vehicle’s rear engine. He immediately pulled over and called 911, but the flames had spread too quickly for the trolley to be salvaged.<a href="http://carlvlewis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-06-at-2.27.16-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-431 alignright" title="Screen shot 2011-03-06 at 2.27.16 AM" src="/assets/Screen-shot-2011-03-06-at-2.27.16-AM-166x300.png" alt="" width="166" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>No students were injured in the incident, and the driver escaped from the smoldering vehicle unscathed.</p>
<p>Chief Gary Collins with the Mercer Police department said officers arrived at the scene within five minutes to find Miss Molly almost totally destroyed.</p>
<p>“Miss Molly didn’t make it out alive. When we got there, the trolley was smoking and you could still see some flames. What damage the fire didn’t do, the smoke and water did,” Collins said. “It was awful.”</p>
<p>NewTown Macon owns and operates the trolley service through a contract with the University.</p>
<p>NewTown spokesman Hal Baskin said it appears the fire started in the trolley’s rear engine, but the exact cause of the incident won’t be determined until insurance inspectors can conduct a full investigation next week.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Baskin said he does not believe the fire was caused by a manufacturer’s defect, or that students should have any reason to be fearful of using the trolley service in the future.</p>
<p>“I would expect that this is an isolated incident and not a problematic issue that affects all trolleys . . it was just something that happened,” Baskin said.</p>
<p>Investigators do not suspect foul play was involved in the incident.</p>
<p>NewTown has already begun making plans to replace Miss Molly with a new trolley.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at what other equipment is available to replace Miss Molly, and we’re just waiting to hear back from our insurance inspectors at this point,” Baskin said.</p>
<p>NewTown will continue to provide service in the meantime using its other trolley, “Sweet Melissa,” which is the same model trolley as Miss Molly. Baskin said Sweet Melissa was undergoing precautionary safety inspections on Tuesday to ensure that it is safe to operate.</p>
<p>The student trolley service to downtown should continue as scheduled this week, with Sweet Melissa shifted into full rotation for the time being, Chief Collins said.</p>
<p>“I’m just so grateful that no one was hurt. It could have been worse. I don’t think there’s any reason to worry, though. These sorts of things happen from time to time,” Collins said.</p>
<p>Collins added that he hopes the incident will remind students to remain vigilant and orderly while using the trolley service.</p>
<p>Dean of students Doug Pearson told The Cluster Tuesday afternoon that he’s not sure yet if the incident will have any significant impact on student trolley services in the future.</p>
<p>“It’s possible that because there’s only one trolley for now that there could be minor disruptions in service in the coming weeks. Obviously, we’ll notify students of any schedule changes via email and Bear Blurbs as soon as they happen,” Pearson said.</p>
<p>Miss Molly was purchased by the Macon Transit Authority in 2001 at a price tag of $127,000, then later sold to NewTown Macon for $160,000 in 2004. It had an estimated capacity of 40 people, and had been used in recent years to to give daytime tours of local historic sites as well as transport students to downtown Macon at night.</p>
<p>The trolley was named after Macon-born musician Little Richard’s 1958 hit song, “Good Golly Miss Molly.”</p>
