        Response to "Six Provocations for Big Data," Boyd and Crawford (2011)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2012</span>

    <p>Setting the guidelines for the social, political and human consequences of research in the database age is an issue that has yet to be fully explored. On one hand, the champions of publicness and digital democracy argue for absolute transparency and data freedom. On the other, privacy advocates consistently take issue with what they see as a potential threat to individual liberty. In their 2011 paper “Six Provocations for Big Data,” Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford attempt to bridge this divide by laying out the basic principles of  what they call ‘Big Data,’ as well as a broad set of principles that should guide researchers seeking to harness the power of that data for social good.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Boyd and Crawford enumerate the basic misassumption that researchers, academics and media professionals often make when interpreting Big Data: they treat data as an objective and infallible source of knowledge when it is really just a piece of the underlying story. Numbers do not speak for themselves, so we must adapt our methods of research to the demands of new technology. As Latour puts it, “Change the instruments, and you will change the entire social theory that goes with them.”</p>

        Response to Tufte, "Data Analysis for Politics and Policy"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2012</span>

    <p>In the first chapter of his book <em>Data Analysis for Politics and Policy, </em>Yale researcher Edward R. Tufte demonstrates the opportunities as well as the challenges of using data to help inform decisions of public policy. First, Tufte sets forth the various terms and theoretical frameworks he will be using to analyze data. He advocates the use of what he calls a "multivariate analysis" which takes into account several describing variables to understand a problem rather than just one. In scientific settings, it is possible to isolate a single describing (independent) variable from others and provide a control by which to reach a conclusion regarding the cause of a given response (dependent) variable. But in the real world of social problems and political policy, it is often impossible to parse out the effects of the multitude of possible describing variables that may be at play in a given situation. For Tufte, that gives rise to the need for a "statistical technique" that "may help organize or arrange the data so that the numbers speak more clearly to the question of causality." The numbers cannot answer the question of causality, but they can help shed light on it if they are analyzed in such a way that takes into account as many different variables as possible.</p>

        Data visualization, infographic or illustration?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2012</span>

    <p>Check out <a href="http://www.onlinephd.org/evolution-of-google/">this interactive graphic</a> on the rise of Google recently produced by the folks over at <a href="http://onlinephd.org">OnlinePhD.org</a>. It's an innovative example of how developers can use a responsive, single-page interface to convey a broad range of chronological information that would otherwise be crammed into a timeline. The interactivity of the graphic compels the user to click through to see what happens next, and provides a more engaging narrative than a simple linear flow would.</p>
<p>Based upon our various understandings of the terms <em>data visualization</em>, <em>infographic </em>and <em>illustration</em>, which category would this graphic fall into? I'd be most inclined to say it's an infographic rather than an illustration, given that its primary goal is to convey factual information (the chronological rise of Google) rather than just to provide an illustration, which it also does quite nicely. But I wouldn't call it a data visualization, because it's not immediately apparent from first glance what the graphic is trying to illustrate, and the story isn't data-driven. It has a more conventional narrative.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

        Response to Ayres, Norman and Wolfe

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2012</span>

    <p><strong>Response to Ayres and Sweller, "The Split Attention Principle in Multimedia Learning"</strong></p>
<p>Paul Ayres and John Sweller apply the split-attention principle to the design of multimedia instruction, asserting that it is "important to avoid formats that require learners to split their attention between, and mentally integrate, multiple sources of information" (135). This assertion is based on the theory of cognitive load, which refers to the amount of information the brain is able to process at any given point in time. The greater the number of sources of information in multimedia design, the higher the cognitive load required to understand it. An "extraneous" cognitive load, as Ayres and Sweller diagnose it, hinders the learning process by requiring users to split their attention and "mentally integrate the multiple sources of information" (135). As such, it is often necessary for the designer of a piece of multimedia instruction to do as much as possible to present the multiple sources of information in an integrated format.</p>
<p>With practice and expertise, the brain can be taught to expedite the process of piecing together disparate sources of information without need for additional visual aids, such as the algebra student being able to readily identify angle measures of a given shape. But for the novice learner, "substantial cognitive resources will need to be devoted to splitting attention between the disparate sources of information and mentally integrating them" (137). As a way to lessen the cognitive load, then, designers can employ visual cues or "referrents" that help integrate multiple sources of information. Other ways to help learners piece together multiple information sources is what Ayers and Sweller call the "dual mode" of multimedia design, which refers to the use of two different sensory cues, usually sight and sound, to lessen the cognitive load.</p>
<p><strong>Response to Donald Norman, <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></strong></p>
<p>In <em>The Design of Everyday Things, </em>Donald Norman looks at the design of familiar items to explain how to construct effective visual aids. At the heart of all user-friendly designs, Norman asserts, lies two fundamental components: a good "conceptual model" and a logical "visible structure" (13). An effective conceptual model should allow us to predict the outcome of our actions by explaining how an item works in a theoretical manner. Ideally, conceptual models should be as simple as possible, but the presiding imperative must always be accuracy and clarity of explanation. The item itself must also employ a logical visual structure, including the intuitive use of what Norman calls affordances, constraints and mappings. It should be clear to the eye from visual cues what an item can do (its affordances), what it can't do (its constraints) and how to connect the various parts together to perform an operation (mapping).</p>
<p><strong>Response to Wolfe, Visual Search</strong></p>
<p>Jeremy M. Wolfe lays out the basic principles of visual search, shedding light on the often unconscious ways our brains process sensory information based upon certain visual cues. Perhaps most importantly, Wolfe defines the basic structural features of visual search, including color, orientation, motion, size and scale. While many such basic features may appear obvious, Wolfe goes a step further in pointing out the various psychological factors that can come into play in our processing of visual information. For example, in keeping with Plato's idea of forms, Wolfe asserts that an object is more than just the sum of its parts; it is an object in its own right. As soon as attention arrives, Wolfe contends, "an object is not seen as collections of features. It  is an object having certain featural attributes." An object carries with it certain mental associations that change the way users perceive it.</p>

        On Narrow-Minded Conceptions of What Makes One a "Journalist"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>What constitutes a 'journalist' is a semantic debate I've had dozens of times, particularly in grad school and in my previous full-time job as "Digital Media Manager" (another vague term) at Savannah Morning News. Outside of professional spheres, though, the general public discourse goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Random person:</strong> So tell me again: Where do you work?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> At [Insert Publication Name Here].</p>
<p><strong>Random person:</strong> 'Oh, cool! So you're a reporter. What do you write or cover? [insert slight tone of self-righteousness from random person knowing now she makes more than me].</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Well, I write code.</p>
<p><strong>Random person:</strong> So you're a developer?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, in a way, but I build news apps and data projects for editorial purposes, so I'm a journalist, too.</p>
<p><strong>Random person:</strong> 'Oh...."</p></blockquote>
<h2>Typography, design as discourse</h2>
<p>In his essay on text and typography, Lupton touches on the fundamental ideological shift of the digital era: that "the dominant subject is neither reader nor writer but <em>user</em>, a figure conceived as a bundle of words and impairments" (73). In other words, we cannot continue to view the way we communicate with audiences in a traditional, two-dimensional form where only the information <em>we</em> communicate is important. We have to think about how it will be perceived by others. As designers, we cannot simply apply our own artistic sensibilities to the material we produce. We must always keep the user in mind. In the case of typography, this user-centric approach requires what Katherine McCoy calls "redefining typography as discourse." Design is more than a work of authorship. It is a work of communication that challenges "readers to produce their own meanings while also to elevate the status of the designer within the process of authorship" (73). Simply put, <em>design is a conversation, not a sermon.</em></p>
<p><strong>Response to Manovich on the Database</strong></p>
<p>Manovich crystallizes the nature of the database-driven story and its applications to new media by describing them both as essentially dissolutions of the conventional narrative form. Stories told in database form need not follow a linear narrative structure with a beginning, middle and an end. Instead they are what Manovich calls "collections of individual items, with every item possessing the same significance as the other" (218). For Manovich, this database-driven story might take the form of a Twitter stream, which allows stories to be conveyed in small bits rather than packaged into a predefined narrative. But he also makes sure to address the potential pitfalls of this sort of database-driven story: that we  may "have too much information and too few narrative that can tie it all together"; that we may have too many Tweets but no logical or convenient manner of piecing them into a usable format (217). Finding a balance between the competing impulses of  information and narrative, then, leads Manovich to his undergirding call to action: We must devise a system of what he calls "info-aesthetics," a sort of theoretical framework that helps us marry the aesthetic component of information <em>access (</em>i.e. the database-driven model) with the aesthetic components of <em>processing </em>or <em>filtering</em> that help us turn raw information into a coherent fashion (217).</p>
