        Using data-viz to make a wire story stand out from the pack

    <span class="post-date">07 May 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/introducing-the-new-dosavannah-com-and-do-mobile-app/"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2012-05-07-at-1.15.51-AM.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>
    I've been interested lately in finding examples of online-only, collaborative, non-profit newsrooms who've utilized the power of data visualization techniques to give added value to stories that otherwise wouldn't necessarily be unique, and in doing so beat out legacy news organizations who published a text narrative alone. Take, for example, this <a href="http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/12/0503/1747/">data-rich story</a> and interactive map displaying statewide testing results published by <a href="http://njspotlight.com">NJSpotlight</a> Friday. While the news that only 8 out of 10 graduating seniors had passed New Jersey's current standardized test in 2011 was widely reported across the state last week, including by the<em><a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/nj_high_school_graduation_rate_1.html"> Star-Ledger</a></em> in Newark and by <em><a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/high-school-graduation-rates-have-dropped-statewide-under-new-formula/article_051bca92-93d9-11e1-a20c-001a4bcf887a.html">The Press of Atlantic City</a></em>, only NJSpotlight took advantage of the story's strong data element to produce a more concise, data-driven visual narrative.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>So NJSpotlight obviously deserves kudos for the gap they're filling in New Jersey journalism. What's more, the job they did on the <a href="http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/12/0503/1747/">interactive map</a> was fairly sophisticated (I've still yet to figure out how to overlay such a highly customized legend onto a Google map). But as is always the case with any deadline project, there's room for improvement. Let's take a look at the good and the bad of NJSpotlight's Friday package on state test results.</p>
<p>First off, this is a classic example of a story where county and/or municipality polygons with a colored fill layered on top of a Google Map brings new insight to a widely reported story. Not only can we immediately see from the map that most of the state fell within the 75 to 90 percent range in terms of passing rates, but we can also clearly tell that the north-central region of the state, particularly near the Pennsylyvania border, earned significantly higher scores than the rest of New Jersey. The pop-up table with information on vocational and charter schools also adds an additional layer of nuance to the piece, and does a decent job of displaying the numbers in a table-like format.</p>
<p>The map colors follow a somewhat logical pattern, with green representing high-passing rates and red representing lower passing rates. But the orange, yellow and blue colors that fall in the middle do more to obfuscate than they do to help visualize. Without referencing the legend, how is the user supposed to know that blue is better than yellow, or that green is better than blue? What's more, the combination of such bright shades of colors from opposite ends of the color spectrum makes the map less pleasing on the eye than it would've been had the designer chosen more subtle, complimentary shades. I understand the desire to have red represent 'negative' and green represent 'positive,' but if NJSpotlight had went with a graduated color scale from red to green, with neutral-based mid-values such as the ones I used in <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/?p=2024">this recent map</a> on nationwide obesity rates, the map would've been not only aesthetically more appealing, but easier to read.</p>
<p>Another minor criticism I could make of the map is the designer's decision to set the polygon-fills to solid colors with 100 percent opacity. This obscures the underlying view of which cities and townships each shape contains. While I understand the thought-process that likely went into this decision – it's hard to make disparate colors, especially orange and yellow, stand out when layered on a slightly orange-tinted map with road and highway features – the designer could have easily used a tool such as <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">colorbrewer2.org</a> to generate some nice equidistant colors that would've looked fine set to an opacity of about 50 or 60 percent.</p>
<p>For the sake of thoroughness, I also want to address the included table that contains the charter and vocational school data. I like the fact that NJSpotlight chose to alternate the shades of background color for every other row in the table. It helps distinguish each row more easily from its neighbor, and gives an extra visual attribute to what easily could have been a stale grid. My only recommendations might be to split up every five or six rows with a dividing line, and to incorporate a bar chart, if possible, for one of the values in the cell (presumably, the most important value, the percent passing column).</p>

        Overlaying a bubble chart onto a Google map

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/introducing-the-new-dosavannah-com-and-do-mobile-app/"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2012-05-06-at-5.14.26-AM.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>
    Others may <a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2009/01/popping-the-bubble-so-to-speak.html">hate</a>, but I'm a big fan of using bubbles to display data. When implemented correctly (i.e. scaled in terms of area instead of diameter), bubbles can be an aesthetically appealing and concise way to represent the value of data points in an inherently visual format. Bubbles are even more useful when they include interactivity, with events like mouseover and zoom allowing users to drill down and compare similar-sized bubbles more easily than they can in static graphics. So, when I was recently working on a <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/autismdataviz/WebAppHome.html">class project</a> on autism diagnoses in New York City, I decided to use bubbles to represent the percentage of students with individualized education plans at all 1250 or so K-8 New York City schools.<!--more--></p>
<p>Almost by default, I turned to Google Maps JavaScript API V3, mainly because I'm quasi-familiar with its basic functions and event handlers (as I point out later in  this post, I didn't realize that a nifty new service called <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> would have automated most of what I was trying to do, albeit without nearly the level of customization). Nonetheless, based on a <a href="http://karlagius.com/2011/03/26/visualizing-data-with-google-maps/">tutorial</a> from Karl Agius, as well as some infoWindow help from my data viz professor, <a href="http://susanemcgregor.com">Susan McGregor</a>, I created the following interactive bubble map of NYC schools based upon the number of special needs, or IEP, students at each school. The larger the bubble, the greater percentage of special needs students a school has. Click <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/mapTest/">here</a> to see the map full-screen, or <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/bubbleMap.zip">here</a> to download a .zip of my source files for your own customization purposes.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://carlvlewis.net/mapTest/" frameborder="0" width="550" height="330"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Each bubble on this map represents one of New York City's approximately 1,250  K-8 public schools, including charters. The larger the bubble, the higher the percentage of students with individualized education plans (IEP). Click on a bubble to find out more about the school, or click anywhere within a district boundary to see an overall average IEP rate for the district. Zoom and pan to see other parts of the city.</em></p>
<p>You'll notice the opacity for the bubbles is set to 40 percent. This allows us to get a quick visual of the locations with the highest density of special needs students, given that those areas on the map will naturally be darker because they have multiple semi-opaque layers that overlap. Setting a low opacity also prevents overlapping bubbles from covering up one another. You'll also notice that the map includes polygons for each school district, which you can click on to get an average IEP rate for the entire district. I decided against setting gradated fill colors for the school district shapes so as to avoid implying causation, as well as to lessen the visual clutter.*</p>
<h1>Preparing the data</h1>
<p>To create the map, I first had to download the underlying data from the New York City Department of Education <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/data/default.htm">database</a> as a .csv, then import it into Excel to clean it up and leave only the relevant information. Although the dataset I had only included street addresses split into multiple columns, I was able to use the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/concatenate-HP005209020.aspx">concatenate</a> function in Excel to merge the street, city, state and zip columns to get a full street address. From there, I used my <a href="http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/batch-geocode/#.T6V0Op9Yvk0">favorite batch geocoding service</a> to convert the addresses into geographic coordinates that the Google Maps API can read. Check out my resulting .csv file <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/nycpubschools.csv">here</a> for an example. Then I imported the .csv into a Google Spreadsheet, and pasted the resulting spreadsheet's URL into dataSourceURL field in the JavaScript of my main index.html file. Here's how that looked in my code:</p>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">
var dataSourceUrl = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au4D8Alccn4xdHNJdXJmeTdYcEtpRXE1QXRucWtEN3c";
var onlyInfoWindow;

google.load("visualization", "1");
google.load("maps", "3", {other_params:"sensor=false"});

google.setOnLoadCallback(getData);
</pre>
<h1>Drawing the bubbles</h1>
<p>Using the 'Circle' marker style from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps JavaScript V3 API</a>, I set each row in the spreadsheet to draw a bubble whose size corresponded to its value. It works by calling up the 'size' column in my spreadsheet, which contains the IEP data I want to display, and then drawing an overlay of bubbles based upon those values. Credit again to Karl Agius for helping me figure out this part of the script.</p>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">
// This first array is where you can change the size and styling of the bubbles.
function Bubble(data, options) {
    this.data = data;
    if (options) 
        this.options = options 
    else 
        this.options = {
            radiusForPercentage:1000,
            text:{
                visible:false,
                minimumZoom:13,
                maximumZoom:15
            },
            bubble:{
                fill:{color:"#709ED9", opacity:0.6},
                stroke:{color:"#709ED9", weight:1, opacity:0.3}
            }
        };
    this.totalSize = this.getTotalSize(this.data);
}

Bubble.prototype = new google.maps.OverlayView;

Bubble.prototype.onAdd = function() {
    for (var row = 0; row < this.data.getNumberOfRows(); row++) 
        this.drawBubble(this.data, this.options, row);
}

Bubble.prototype.draw = function() {
    if (this.options.text.visible)
        for (var row = 0; row < this.data.getNumberOfRows(); row++) 
            this.drawText(this.data, this.options, row);
}

Bubble.prototype.getTotalSize = function(data) {
    var totalSize = 0;
    
    for (var row = 0; row < data.getNumberOfRows(); row++)
        totalSize += data.getValue(row, 1);
                
    return totalSize;
}

Bubble.prototype.drawBubble = function(data, options, row) {
    
    var sizeOfLocation = data.getValue(row, 1);
    var percentageOfTotal = (sizeOfLocation / this.totalSize) * 100;
            
    var radiusForLocation = options.radiusForPercentage * percentageOfTotal;
            
    var marker = new google.maps.Circle({
        center: new google.maps.LatLng(data.getValue(row, 2), data.getValue(row, 3)),
        fillColor:options.bubble.fill.color,
        fillOpacity:options.bubble.fill.opacity,
        strokeColour:options.bubble.stroke.color,
        strokeWeight:options.bubble.stroke.weight,
        strokeOpacity:options.bubble.stroke.opacity,
        radius:radiusForLocation
 });
    // This last command actually places the Circle markers we just made on the map.
    marker.setMap(this.getMap());
</pre>
<p>You can change the default size of the bubbles with the radiusForPercentage value, and set the colors using the fill and stroke fields. You can also set a minimum and maximum zoom so that users can only see the part of the map you want them to see.</p>
<h1>Adding interactivity</h1>
<p>Next, to make the bubbles clickable, I added an on-click event listener that set each bubble marker to fetch the corresponding data from my Google spreadsheet and add it to an infoWindow. Here's what that looked like:</p>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">var contentString = '
<div id="content">School Name' + data.getValue(row, 0) + 'Percent IEP students:'+sizeOfLocation+'Percent free-lunch:' + data.getValue(row, 4) + '</div>
';

var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({
content: contentString,
position: new google.maps.LatLng(data.getValue(row, 2), data.getValue(row, 3))

});

google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
if(onlyInfoWindow != null){
onlyInfoWindow.close();
}

infowindow.open(this.getMap());
onlyInfoWindow = infowindow;

});</pre>
<p>As you can see, I referenced each value in my spreadsheet by adding in its row number. Later, I went back in and added another row of data that displayed free-lunch statistics as well, which is why you see a reference to row 4.</p>
<h1>Overlaying the school district polygons</h1>
<p>To place the school polygons onto the map, I added a new overlay that pointed to a Google Fusions table containing the KML geographic boundaries. This is what that looked like:</p>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">
var schoolDistricts = new google.maps.LatLng(41.850033, -87.6500523);

var layer = new google.maps.FusionTablesLayer({
  query: {
    select: 'geometry',
    from: '3621394'
  },
  styles: [{
  polygonOptions: {
    fillColor: "#FAFBFF",
    fillOpacity: 0
    }
  }
  ]}
  );

layer.setMap(map);
  }
</pre>
<p>The 'from' field should correspond to your Fusions Table's six-digit ID, and the 'select' field should reference the column in your table that contains the KML geographic data.</p>
<h1>A simpler new tool to do roughly the same thing</h1>
<p>Ultimately, however, it may have been easier to use the WYSIWYG editor from <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>, a premium mapping service with a front-end interface similar to Google Fusions Tables except that it allows you to draw bubbles without having to dig into the API. See what happened when I uploaded my spreadsheet to CartoDB and set similar style attributes:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://carlvlewis.cartodb.com/tables/nycpubschools/embed_map" width="550" height="330"></iframe></p>
<p>Which map is better? Personally I think the hand-coded Google Maps API version is better in terms of aesthetics and usability. But was it worth the extra effort? You tell me.</p>
<p><i>*<a href="http://www.propublica.org/site/author/jennifer_lafleur">Jennifer LaFleur</a>, ProPublica's director of computer-assisted reporting, later pointed out to me that I could easily add a gradated fill for each of the school district polygons based upon poverty levels, provided that I pick the right color-scheme to complement the blue bubbles. I guess I was just a bit leery from a design standpoint about what one color on top of another would look like.</i></p>

        Why calculus matters when it comes to data-driven stories
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/why-calculus-matters-when-it-comes-to-data-driven-stories/"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/350px-Standard_deviation_diagram.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>
    A quick refresher from my data visualization <a href="http://susanemcgregor.com/">professor</a> here at Columbia a couple of weeks ago reminded me why I was forced to spend all those grueling hours calculating standard deviation back in high school.</p>
<p>See, when you're using a data set to tell a story, the first step is to understand what that data says. And to do that, you've got to have a good idea of the range and variation of the values at hand. Not only can figuring that information out help you determine whether there's any statistical significance to your data set, but it can also pinpoint outliers and possible errors that may exist within the data before you begin the work of visualizing it.</p>
<p>Thanks to powerful processing programs like Excel, we can figure out the variability of data sets pretty easily using the program's built-in standard deviation function (remember <a href="http://standard-deviation.appspot.com/">this</a> intimidating-looking equation from calculus class?). Still, it always helps to know how to calculate the information out by hand, if only to get a conceptual idea of why numbers such as the standard deviation (the variability of a data-set) and the z-value (the number of standard deviations a given value is away from the mean) even matter in the first place when it comes to data visualization.</p>
<p>So, to brush up on my formulas and also better understand the numbers behind an <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/?p=2024">actual story assignment</a> for one of my classes, I recently hand-calculated the standard deviation and z-values for a set of data on state-by-state obesity rates. From my calculations, I was able to use the standard deviation (3.24) to determine that, on average, most states fell within the middle of the bell-curve for the average national obesity rate (27.1 percent) . In addition, the z-values helped me understand which states stood out from the pack as possible outliers (Mississippi is by far the most obese with a 2.13 z-value, Colorado the least obese with a -1.9 z-value). To get an idea of how those formulas look hand-calculated in Excel, check out my spreadsheet <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/Lewis_stateobesityrates_standarddev.xlsx">here</a>. And keep these formulas in mind while working on your next data story. They can potentially save you time and effort by helping you figure out what your data set says <em>before</em> you have to go through the often-lengthy process of visualizing it.</p>

        What makes BostonGlobe.com "the world's best designed website"
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2012</span>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/what-makes-bostonglobe-com-the-worlds-best-designed-website/"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2012-04-16-at-1.30.23-PM.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>
    With the Pulitzer Price announcements coming up later this afternoon, you'd think I'd be writing about whose up for the "Best Deadline Reporting" or "Best Public Service Journalism" prizes. But instead I want to talk about a different media award doled out during the past week: BostonGlobe.com's designation as the <a href="http://www.snd.org/2012/04/snd33-worlds-best-designed-website-bostonglobe-com/">"world's best designed website"</a> by the Society for News Design. Put simply, I can't say I disagree.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yet before I divulge in my effusive praise of the folks in Boston, let me point out that I'm still somewhat skeptical of the business-logic behind The Globe's <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/12/boston-globe-launches-pay-site_n_957410.html">decision</a> to launch its <a href="http://bostonglobe.com">paywall-only site</a> last fall alongside its primary news portal, <a href="http://boston.com">Boston.com</a>. From a revenue standpoint, I can't see the full-paywall site, BostonGlobe.com, bringing in nearly enough subscription income to compensate for the traffic and ad dollars it will, and to some degree <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/boston.com">already has</a>, leeched from Boston.com (at last count, in February, BostonGlobe.com had only recruited about <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/mediajobsdaily/the-nyt-company-has-406000-paid-digital-subscribers_b9817">16,000 paid digital subscribers</a>, many of whom had taken advantage of the site's introductory offer of 99 cents for the first four weeks but may not stick it out past the trial period). It might've been wiser for the paper to start out with a metered paywall to warm users to the idea of paying for content before erecting a full-blown ten-foot-tall paywall around its most valuable content under a new, separate domain name. But then again, who really knows – maybe it's a step in the right direction longterm? I'm not the one having to make the tough calls, so I'm in no position to judge.</p>
<p>At any rate, the segregation of the two sites has given the paper's parent company the freedom to make BostonGlobe.com a rich, immersive and interactive user experience that few other news organizations can match. Why, you ask? Because of a little trend gaining steam in the development world called <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">"responsive design." </a>See, BostonGlobe.com isn't only a standout site because of its sophisticated use of white space, its wholehearted <a href="http://fontsinuse.com/bostonglobe-com/">embrace of web fonts</a> and its visual-first approach to story art, but also because of its cross-platform capabilities. No matter what device you view BostonGlobe.com on – desktop, tablet or mobile – the site retains its same slick look and feel. The site's adaptive technology allows it to detect the screen size of the user, then adjust its layout to fit the exact resolution at hand. On desktops, that means content stretches to fill the entire browser window, and the grid restructures itself appropriately when you decrease or increase the size of the window. This eliminates the need for time-honored design standards like the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid-system</a>, which is based upon the Desktop-centric idea that all users have at least a 960px resolution. Now, the grid can be as big, or as small, as the user wants it to be.</p>
<p>The site's successful display of a dynamic range of real-time content on any-sized device also essentially eliminates the need for the "app-based" environment that's been the staple of the iOS5 and Android operating systems in recent years. To test it out, I gave the site a whirl on my iPad, and was pleased to see the front page neatly rearrange itself to fit the new orientation, just as any of the best platform-specific news apps out there do, including <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-new-yorker-magazine/id370614765?mt=8">The New Yorker </a>and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wired-magazine/id373903654?mt=8">Wired</a> apps for iPad. But just because BostonGlobe.com doesn't <em>need</em> a native app to display its content beautifully on tablet and mobile devices doesn't mean that it won't be missing out on the growing app-centric marketplace for publishers. As Apple and Google continue to centralize digital consumption patterns into the app-based model, BostonGlobe.com may be a little too ambitious in thinking it doesn't need to play nice with the big-boy tech companies to reach its audience. On the other hand, however, it could prove to be a brilliant move for the paper, setting an example for other publishers and app-based companies in general who want to break free from the often constricting, not to mention pricey, cost of participating in the app marketplace.</p>
<p>For its design alone, BostonGlobe.com deserves any number of awards. Its bold, minimalist interface allows content to shine above all else, free from clutter and distraction. And with high-res horizontal photos, block-quotes, inline video and stylized headlines that grab your attention without hurting your eyes, that content stands out even more. What's more, the site has the <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/features/">functionality</a> to back up its aesthetics. Its "Save" feature allows users to bookmark articles for reading offline on any device, which, even for sites without responsive design, is a brilliant feature for a news site to implement. Moreover, its "Story Flow" panel at the bottom of each article allows users to click seamlessly through to stories on similar subjects, just as readers would in an old-fashioned newspaper with physical sections. Which leaves me with one nagging question: Is BostonGlobe.com too imitative of physical newspapers to attain success in today's short attention-span digital audience? Is it <em>too</em> skewmorphic to succeed in an SEO-driven, hyperlinked news economy?</p>
<p>I guess we'll have to wait and see.</p>

        Using data analysis to assess a digital news startup's future

    In a March 2011 <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-the-full-monty-2011-3">blog post</a>, BusinessInsider.com Editor-in-Chief <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hblodget">Henry Blodget</a> gleefully announced that the startup tech and business news site had turned a net profit of $2,127 during fiscal year 2010 – just enough, in his words, “to buy a MacBook Pro.” While that may sound like chump change for most any business, in the rough-and-tumble world of startup media companies, it's almost like getting a six-figure salary. As Blodget puts it,</p>
<blockquote><p>Making $2,127 feels about 2,127 times as good as losing money. And it makes us confident that, if we keep working hard, and we keep getting better, we'll be able to build a successful business and a truly <em>great </em>product someday.</p></blockquote>
<p>In less than two years since its launch in February 2009, BusinessInsider.com had achieved what most other media startups only dream of: turning a profit. Blodget also pointed out that the company had taken in $4.8 million in revenue during 2010, almost all of which came from online advertising. Since then, executives from the company have yet to provide any further updates as to how the site fared financially in 2011. But a close look at the numbers shows that, assuming the company’s ad rates and inventory held steady, Business Insider nearly doubled its annual revenue to somewhere closer to $8.5 million in 2011. That makes it one of the most successful online media sites of its scale.<!--more--></p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><b>HOW I CAME UP WITH THIS FIGURE</b></span></p>
<p>First off, I tried as much as possible to rely upon BusinessInsider.com's internal traffic statistics provided by Google Analytics, rather than on numbers from outside services such as  <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/businessinsider.com#!traffic">Quantcom</a> or <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/businessinsider.com#!traffic">Alexa</a>. For one thing, the internal numbers represent what's being used to balance the company's ledger books and set ad rates, and are by their very nature more accurate. The problem, however, is that those numbers aren't available to the public. But, drawing upon a snippet of information provided by Blodget in his <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-the-full-monty-2011-3">full-monty inside look</a> into the company, we can calculate a rough estimate of what those numbers would be for 2011.</p>
<p>According to the internal Google Analytics <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-the-full-monty-2011-3">data</a> cited by Blodget, BusinessInsider.com attracted 7.8 million unique visitors during March 2011. Quantcast, however, estimates that the site’s number of unique visitors during the same period was closer to 6.3 million, or about 20 percent less than the figure provided by Google Analytics.  Given this disparity in analytics, if we take the average number of visitors per month provided by Quantcast for all of 2011 (7.55 million) and add 20 percent to that figure, we can reach a closer estimate of the site’s internal annual traffic in 2011 as monitored by Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Judged using this formula, BusinessInsider.com received somewhere on average of about 9 million global unique visitors per month in 2011, or about 110 million per year. Let’s compare that to the total annual visitorship for the site in 2010, which, according to the same calculations, comes out to be about 4.4 million per month and 52.8 million per year. That represents a stunning rate of growth of close to 100 percent year-on-year. See Chart A below to get an idea of how quickly BusinessInsider.com’s traffic skyrocketed in late 2010 and early 2011:</p>
<p><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js">// <![CDATA[<br />

<p>Now that we have a more accurate figure for BusinessInsider.com's actual number of unique visitors in 2011, we can use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user">ARPU</a> (average revenue per user) formula to calculate backwards and determine the actual gross revenue generated. In 2010, Business Insider had an ARPU of about 94 cents, meaning that for each unique visitor the site received, the company received 94 cents<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>. So, if in 2011 the site received 9 million unique visitors per month at the same ARPU, it stands to reason that the company raked in an estimated $8.5 million. That’s almost nearly double what it brought the year before.  See Chart B for a side-by-side comparison of the disparity between unique visitors from 2010 to 2011:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/visitorship21.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2263" title="visitorship2" src="/assets/visitorship21-1024x594.png" alt="" width="491" height="285" /></a></p>
<p>But what caused such dramatic growth for Business Insider in such a short span of time? That’s where understanding the company’s business model comes into play.</p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><b>BUSINESSINSIDER.COM'S BUSINESS MODEL</b></span></p>
<p>Citing the company’s healthy cash infusion from a group of venture capitalists in 2010, Blodget buffeted his celebratory March 2011 blog post by warning that the slim profit margins may not last for long, as the company planned to invest and expand its operations and spend every extra cent it brings in on growth. The company added 15 additional employees to its payroll shortly thereafter, reaching its current staff of around 60 people. In addition, it acquired a number of new verticals such as Silicon Alley Insider, a tech news blog, and Clusterstock, a popular market-analysis site. The company also began expanding its coverage areas from just tech and business into a wider range of topics, with sections such as ‘Life,’ ‘Politics’ and ‘Entertainment,’ although the general content of the site still remains primarily geared towards a male demographic Another way the site broadened its reach was by simply posting more content, much of it aggregated from other sites.<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>  Such expansions help explain the site’s immense jump in traffic during 2011, as well as its growing reputation as an “over-aggregator,” as many have derided The Huffington Post.</p>
<p>The  site’s impressive statistics and growing Web presence attracted an <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/media/column-post/business-insider-nets-7-million-funding-31216">additional $7 million</a> in funding from investors in September 2011, thereby allowing BusinessInsider.com to expand its operations even more by posting more original content and aggregating more stories from outside news organizations. But its traffic began to stall and eventually dip in late 2011 and early 2012, suggesting that the site may possibly be encountering growing pains. After all, now that it’s expanded beyond its niche, it has to worry about growing competition from similar news aggregators with far vaster resources, such as The Huffington Post, Gawker and The Daily Beast.  Not to mention, further along in the future, the growing use of social media as an aggregation tool threatens to hamper the added value Business Insider’s style of curation brings. With our social spheres becoming the primary method by which many of now curate and aggregate news online, will there be any need for "professional curation," such as that practiced by Business Insider?</p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><b>WHY ANY OF THIS MATTERS</b></span></p>
<p>The case of BusinessInsider.com shows that digital news can indeed be a profitable business model, at least given certain economies of scale and at this point in time. But as the company roars on into 2012, Blodget and other top-level employees may want to think twice before taking any corporate six-figure salaries or extended holiday vacations and instead continue investing every spare resource they have on setting the site apart from the pack. If Business Insider is indeed seeking to establish itself as a viable competitor to <a href="http://gawker.com">Gawker</a> and <a href="http://huffingtonpost.com">The Huffington Post</a>, it may want to consider doing whatever it can to make its product a better alternative. For example, it could position itself as a “smarter” Huffington Post –– one that still takes full advantage of the networked, curated power of the Web to publish and aggregate, but without celebrity coverage*. Or it could present itself as a more “traditional” news organization than Gawker*, which posts its content in a more blog-like format geared toward a younger, web-savvier demographic. Whatever Business Insider does, however, one thing remains clear: BusinessInsider.com has no competitive advantage over the marketplace. Without significant barriers to entry into its business model, the company will need to find a way to retain its audience if it wants to succeed in the longterm.</p>
<p><em>*Disclaimer: I love both HuffPo and Gawker, so I'm not bashing them, just pointing out how BusinessInsider could capitalize on real or perceived differences by highlighting its contrasts.</em></p>

<p><a title="" href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> This methodology takes into account the ARPU (average revenue per user), which is calculated by dividing the total revenue per year by the number of unique visitors each month. Business Insider’s ARPU in 2010 was around 94 cents. Applying that same ARPU to 2011’s traffic, we can estimate that the site earned somewhere around $8.5 million in gross revenue in 2011.</p>
