<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Following van Rij’s remarks, two OUCA members stood and condemned his comments as “despicable and unacceptable,” and Oxford Union President Laura Winwood assured the crowd that “misogyny is not tolerated” on Union premises.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Jocky McLean––an OUCA member who demanded an apology from van Rij in front of the 120 member audience––said he heard van Rij tell the female speaker, Isabella Burton, to stick to “pans and brooms” instead of giving speeches about politics.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“As she continued, [van Rij] started getting louder and louder in an attempt to shut her up. As soon as she finished, I stood up and asked him to apologise to her, and pointed to his disgusting behaviour,” McLean said.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Van Rij left the room after coming under fire from McLean and Winwood for the sexist statements, but returned a few minutes later to his seat.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Winwood said she and others asked van Rij to leave Union premises. The President of the UCL Conservative Association then escorted van Rij out of the room, and he did not return for the remainder of the night.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“The individual was promptly ejected from the room, order restored and the debate continued,” Winwood said.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Burton, the female OUCA member at the podium when van Rij allegedly made the remarks, said she heard about the commotion after it happened and was highly offended by van Rij’s comments.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">---</p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">In addition, a Facebook account in van Rij’s name disappeared from search results after a reporter from this paper attempted to contact him via the social networking site on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">On his Facebook profile, van Rij listed his favourite quotation as one from Hendrik Verwoerd, a pro-Apartheid Prime Minister from South Africa. The quotation calls for “the preservation of the white man and his state.”</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Numerous students have also expressed concern that the way in which van Rij presented himself at the event might have been a deliberate nod to Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">David Thomas, an OUCA member who attended the event and sat near van Rij, said van Rij was sporting a “Hitler-esque” groomed mustache and slicked back hair.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“It looked as though he was deliberately trying to imitate Hitler with his appearance,” Thomas said.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">OUCA President Natalie Shina refused to comment on van Rij’s appearance.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Shina also said OUCA did not invite van Rij to the event.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Shina said van Rij tagged along with members of the Conservative Association of University College London, who she had invited to Oxford to celebrate OUCA’s reaffiliation with the University.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“The UCL Conservatives invited him without my knowledge,” Shina said.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But UCL Conservative Association President Will Hall also denied inviting van Rij.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“We didn’t invite him or anyone else from King’s College, but he may have found out about it from our Facebook group,” Hall said.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Hall said the incident demonstrates a “systematic failure” on the part of the society in ensuring that only invited individuals are allowed to attend events.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“Every group has at least one or two abhorrent individuals, and in the future we need to find a better way to identify ours and ban them from attending events,” Hall said.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">---</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong>OUCA SECRECY</strong></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But after being presented with eyewitness evidence from a reporter, Shina acknowledged the derogatory comments may have been uttered.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Nine students have confirmed to The Oxford Student that they heard van Rij shout the sexist remark.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But many OUCA members refused to talk after the group’s President issued what one senior OUCA member called a “gag order” preventing members from talking about the event.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“She basically told us all to say that we hadn’t heard anything,” said the member, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Poppy Simister, an ex-officer of OUCA who overheard van Rij’s remark, said she heard about the silencing order from other members and didn’t think it was a good move for OUCA.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">“I don’t really understand the strategy of telling everyone not to talk, especially in a case like this where both OUCA and the Union dealt with the incident fairly quickly,” Simister said.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Shina dismissed the claim that she was deliberately gagging members from speaking, and said the society’s constitution dictates that as President only she is allowed to talk to the press.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Shina said both OUCA and the UCL Conservative Society have banned van Rij from all future events after conducting an internal investigation.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Michael Rock, president of the national party’s youth wing, said he did not think the evidence was strong enough to launch an investigation at the time.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Despite having been informed of the Union President’s statement on the event, Rock said he thought the allegations were simply part of a calculated attack on OUCA: “It seems to me that people are just making accusations to make OUCA look bad.”</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The claims of sexism come at an unfortunate time for OUCA, which finally won back the “U” in its name and regained formal recognition from the University last Friday. The University had cut ties with OUCA last August after it was revealed that a member told a racist joke at the society’s officer hustings.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">A spokeswoman for the National Conservative Party said the party was looking into the allegations, and wanted to stress OUCA is in no way affiliated with the Tory party nationally.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">A University spokesman declined to comment on whether proctors would launch an investigation into the incident, or if the University would continue to allow OUCA to use the University’s name.</p>

<p>If it was a celebration marking a return to the fold, it didn't quite work out as planned.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-244 alignright" title="Picture 3" src="/assets/Picture-3-300x158.png" alt="Picture 3" width="192" height="101" />A year ago Oxford University Conservative Association was banned from using the college title in its name because of a row over racism.</p>
<p>But with that in the past, it was time to resume its affiliation and move on. Or at least it would have been had the association not been plunged into a fresh controversy - this time over sexism.</p>
<p>As a female speaker gave forth in a debate about education, she was taunted by a student shouting 'kitchen, kitchen shush up woman, go back to the kitchen'.</p>
<p>According to one witness, when Oxford student Isabella Burton continued, Vitus van Rij, 18, suggested she stick to 'pan and brooms' instead of giving speeches about politics.</p>
<p>Given that the OUCA president is a woman and there were many women in the 120-strong audience, it is perhaps not surprising that van Rij was given a swift dressing down.</p>
<p>Two male students stood up and condemned his comments as 'despicable and unacceptable'.</p>
<p>Oxford Union president Laura Winwood, who was also present, said three female association members were 'quite distressed' by the outburst.</p>
<p>Van Rij is said to have left the room after coming under fire, but returned a few minutes later, only to be escorted from the premises.</p>
<p>The student sported a tiny moustache and slicked back hair in a severe parting for the evening, which had been billed as a 'port and policy' event.</p>
<p>Quite how he came to be there is something of a mystery. OUCA president Natalie Shina insisted she did not invite the student.</p>
<p>She said he must have tagged along with members of the Conservative Association of University College London, who she had invited to the event.</p>
<p>But UCL said it had not invited van Rij.</p>
<p>As for van Rij himself, he has kept a low profile since student journalists at Oxford University started trying to contact him.</p>
<p>Van Rij is understood to be a member of the War Studies Society at King's in London as well as a member of a university polo club.</p>
<p>OUCA was at the centre of a racism storm last June. During a drunken hustings for the next president for the body, candidates made racist remarks.</p>
<p>The group, whose former presidents include Margaret Thatcher and William Hague, was subsequently barred from using the university name.</p>
<p>Van Rij has since returned to his native Belgium but told about his behaviour, his ex-girlfriend, Suzanne Kimman, 19, rolled her eyes and said: 'It sounds like something he would do.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Some non-UK students had the chance to vote fraudulently in last week’s election because of lax safeguards and mistaken electoral rolls—and at least 13 foreign students claim to have actually voted illegally, an <em>Oxford Student</em> investigation has revealed.</p>
<p>Eight of the students interviewed declined to speak on the record or reveal their college affiliation publicly, citing concerns about revealing publicly that they broke the law or – more frequently – not wishing to speak negatively about College administrators who failed to compare for accuracy the data provided to them by local electoral officials.</p>
<p>Max Gallien, a German student at Queen’s College – who as an EU citizen was eligible to vote in the local council election but not in the general election – said he cast a ballot in the Oxford East parliamentary contest after election workers confirmed to him he could vote in both races.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Gallien said election workers handed him the national ballot even after he told them he was a German citizen and not allowed to vote: “It said on their list that I was allowed to vote for parliament, too,” he said. “So I did.”</p>
<p>Gallien said he assumed he was wrong about the rules. Later that day, he confirmed from a search online that he was indeed ineligible to vote for parliamentary races.</p>
<p>At least two EU students at Balliol and one American student at Queen’s also claimed to have voted illegally, providing their names and college affiliations to <em>The Oxford Student</em> on the condition that the information be used to verify the story, but not for publication. Administrators at both colleges confirmed the three students were inaccurately reported as British citizens in data provided to them by local electoral officials, but denied blame on their end.</p>
<p>A first-year American student at Queen’s – who should have been entirely ineligible to vote in any race as neither an EU nor a Commonwealth citizen – said he voted at the St Clement’s polling station after receiving both polling cards in the mail.</p>
<p>“When I handed them the polling cards I'd gotten, they handed me both ballots, and I didn’t really say anything,” the student said.</p>
<p>Both students at Queen’s had been mistakenly entered as British citizens on the electoral register.</p>
<p>An administrator at Queen’s blamed local authorities for the error. She said the College just exported data they already had on students.</p>
<p>“We don’t change anything – there is no opportunity for it to be corrupted,” she said. "It's not our job to clean up data given to us by officials."</p>
<p>To test the difficulty of verifying such electoral data, a reporter from this paper entered the personal data provided by the two Queens students into two separate Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, one with the correct data and the other with the incorrect data. The paper then added in matching data for 800 different dummy records, similar to the records that would have been on file with the College internally.</p>
<p>A simple Excel 'Compare Sheets' function then identified the two inaccuracies out of all 802 entries within a few seconds' time.</p>
<p>The same Queens administrator who earlier acknowledged the inaccuracy was informed of the results of <em>The Oxford Student</em>'s test, but refused to speak any further on the issue, saying she had already made clear that the College isn't responsible for errors made by local election officials.</p>
<p><strong>A CLOSE RACE, BUT NO EASY WAY TO TELL HOW MANY INCORRECT POLLING CARDS WERE SENT</strong></p>
<p>It is unclear how many foreign citizens might have been mistakenly allowed to vote in the general election, but the close margins of some contests mean any error could be significant.</p>
<p>Oxford West incumbent Evan Harris lost his re-election bid by just 176 votes. Harris’s campaign did not return questions about whether he would challenge the vote; his challenger, Nicola Blackwood, also did not respond to requests for comment by the time this paper went to print.</p>
<p>At least four undergraduate EU citizens at Harris Manchester College were mistakenly sent polling cards for both the local election and the general election, but were given the correct ballot at the polling station.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the national election commission confirmed that EU citizens eligible to vote only in local elections should have received polling cards – which tell voters what elections they are registered for, and where to go to vote – for those contests only. Local authorities were responsible for organizing voter registration and mailing polling cards, he said.</p>
<p>A worker at the Oxford election commission confirmed that EU citizens should not have been sent polling cards for the general election. If they were sent those cards, she said, there “wouldn’t be anything stopping them” from voting for a parliamentary candidate – “but they shouldn’t have done so.”</p>
<p>The confusion and apparent lack of safeguards raise worries about the integrity of last week’s elections in Oxford and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Multiple students told reporters of voting without being asked for identification, while national media reported “chaotic” scenes at polling stations around the country last week along with dozens of allegations of postal vote fraud.</p>
<p><em>OxStu reporters Winston Featherly-Bean and Matt Thompson-Ryder also contributed to this report. Additionally, t</em><em>he identities of all college officials and named sources were verified independently by the paper's legal counsel before publication of this story.</em></p>

    <p>"Slay the Jews?!"</p>
<p>Police report contradicts Israeli minister's allegation of racist abuse by Union member (<a href="http://oxfordstudent.com/2010/05/09/slay-the-jews/">link to story on OxfordStudent.com</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://69.89.31.238/~carlvlew/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Picture-2.png"><img class="alignright" title="Picture 2" src="/assets/Picture-2-241x300.png" alt="Picture 2" /></a></p>

<p>Police have found no evidence for the widely reported claim that a student protester yelled "Slay the Jews" during an Israeli minister's speech at the Oxford Union last term.</p>
<p>A video analysis of the event has revealed that Noor Rashid, a third-year at Teddy Hall, gave an accurate account to authorities concerning what he shouted at Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon.</p>
<p>It did not find any evidence that Rashid uttered the Arabic phrase “Idhbah al-yahud,” meaning "kill the Jews," as Mr. Ayalon told the audience, and other media outlets have previously suggested.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>According to the report, Rashid's actual remark in Arabic translates as  "Khaybar, khaybar, O Jews, the army of Muhammad will return," a phrase which is based on a classical Arabic chant concerning a seventh-century battle between Arabs and Jews at Khaybar, in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Ayalon said the Deputy Foreign Minister stands by his original claim that Rashid made anti-Semitic remarks, but admits he may have misinterpreted or misheard what the student actually said.</p>
<p>"It was very loud, and a lot of people were shouting at once. But even if we misheard the student, what he claims he shouted still has the same threatening, violent and genocidal intent, and is highly inflammatory. We find it very unfortunate that he is not being found guilty," Ayalon's spokesman said.</p>
<p>Rashid said his remark may have been distasteful but it was not intended as anti-Semitic. He said he meant it simply as a metaphor for the Palestinian people overcoming adversity.</p>
<p>"I never said to kill the Jews. I think anti-Semitism is deplorable. Sure, what I shouted wasn't the nicest thing in the world, but it's entirely different than advocating genocide," Rashid said.</p>
<p>Otared Haidar, an Arabic scholar at Oxford's Oriental Institute, referred to Rashid's remark as an "outdated slogan that should not be used."</p>
<p>"It's better that we speak in modern terms, and a lot more civil," Haidar said.</p>
<p>The 8th February incident drew national media attention after Ayalon accused Rashid during the event of calling for the slaughter of Jews and later posted the accusation on his Twitter page.</p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts of the event varied widely as few of those in attendance spoke Arabic and could interpret or remember what Rashid said.</p>
<p>Rashid called coverage of the incident "provocative, inflammatory and slanderous to my name."</p>
<p>"Now when people Google my name, hate speech comes up that I didn't actually say," he said.</p>
<p>Rashid said he considered pressing charges against the Cherwell newspaper after it published an account stating the allegations against him as fact, but eventually relented because of legal costs.</p>
<p>Thames Valley Police have dropped their investigation into Rashid, citing a lack of evidence.</p>
<p>"We take accusations of racist hate speech very seriously, and we could not find any proof that such behavior took place in this incident," a police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>An Oxford Union official has confirmed that Rashid will remain a Union member.</p>

<p>Eruption scatters students across the globe</p>
<p>By Carl Lewis</p>

<p>22 April 2010</p>

<p>When second year Lady Margaret Hall student Matthew Nicholl flew home to Northern Ireland for the Easter holiday last month, he knew it might be a hectic time of the year to travel. What he didn't know, however, is that a volcanic ash cloud would get in his way.</p>
<p>"It's the last thing I was worried about. And now I'm in an awful situation. I have absolutely no idea when I can get a flight back," Nicholl said.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Hundreds of Oxford students like Nicholl are stuck abroad after ash plumes from a volcanic eruption in Iceland last Thursday forced closure of UK airspace indefinitely.</p>
<p>Many of Oxford's more than 6,000 international students are stranded at home, and still more students who went on holiday during the break are scattered across the globe, unable to return for pending exams and lectures.</p>
<p>The University Athletics Club has been stuck in Portugal since Friday, where it was conducting warm-weather training during the break.</p>
<p>Claire Baouduin, a member of the club, said she and her teammates have decided to abandon their flights and instead make the 30-hour long journey back by bus and train.</p>
<p>But Isabella Eichler, a postgraduate student at the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, was not so lucky.</p>
<p>After her flight to Heathrow was canceled midair Thursday, Eichler found that all the train tickets to London were already sold out, forcing her father to make the nine hour drive from Germany to get her back to Oxford on time.</p>
<p>"Thirty minutes into the flight the pilot suddenly announced that we were about to turn around back to Dusseldorf because Heathrow had just shut down. I wasted hours of precious dissertation writing spending Thursday afternoon trying to get out of Germany and make the car journey back," Eichler said.</p>
<p>Students are not only missing exams, but social events and other obligations as well.</p>
<p>At Exeter College, a number of stranded students have requested refunds for the college ball, which is scheduled for this Saturday.</p>
<p>The Ball Committee has so far refused to offer refunds, saying that "on the list of things we didn't plan for, right below 'alien invasion' was 'volcanic ash cloud closing down European airspace."</p>
<p>Some colleges have begun organising help for students whose flights have been delayed. St John's' alumni have given accommodation and financial assistance to members of the College choir who were delayed in New York.</p>
<p>But for Nicholl, who will be unable to return to school for at least another five days, nothing can make up for the frustration of being stuck in limbo.</p>
<p>"I'm missing my collections. I'm missing getting to spend time with my friends before term starts. And the worst part is that I don't know whether to start packing or to start studying. It's quite annoying," Nicholl said.</p>

<p>Public college students in the midstate may experience canceled classes, longer lines at the cafeteria and less one-on-one time with their professors this fall.</p>
<p>As part of a new cost-cutting measure approved Wednesday by the Georgia Board of Regents, faculty and staff at Georgia’s colleges and universities will take six furlough days during the upcoming academic year. The measure is expected to save the state $42 million.</p>
<p><!--more--> “The university system is no more immune from the impacts of this economy than any other organization,” Chancellor Erroll B. Davis said. “There will be impacts, but we will try to keep the impacts on students to a minimum.”</p>
<p>Still, it won’t be easy to cushion all students from the cuts.</p>
<p>At Fort Valley State University, officials will most likely close the campus altogether during the furlough days, spokeswoman Vickie Oldham said.</p>
<p>“Closing down is something we hate to do, but it’s best to do it that way because it saves on energy and utility costs,” Oldham said.</p>
<p>Terrance Smith, FVSU’s vice president of student affairs, said he hopes the university won’t be forced to shut down. If it does, officials will try to schedule closures during days that will impact students the least, he said.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at maybe a day or two during the Thanksgiving holiday or Christmas break,” Smith said.</p>
<p>At Macon State College, classes won’t be canceled, but students could have a harder time scheduling appointments with their academic advisers, spokesman Bill Weaver said.<br />
“We’re hoping the impact upon students will be negligible ... but it is possible that there could be some very minimal time delays in getting seen,” he said.</p>
<p>Weaver said Macon State officials are trying to schedule professors’ days off during weekdays when they don’t teach classes, but plans are still preliminary.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of things we don’t know yet. Does everybody have to take the same day off? Could we take half days?” Weaver said.</p>
<p>At Middle Georgia College in Cochran, quality of student services will be impacted across the board, President Michael Stoy said.</p>
<p>“It’s going to cause us to stagger our workload, which could cause students to see longer lines at places like the registrar’s office,” Stoy said.</p>
<p>Georgia College &amp; State University hasn’t decided yet how it will implement the furloughs, but university operations will be impacted significantly, Georgia College President Dorothy Leland said.</p>
<p>“Collectively, the furloughs represent the loss of approximately 37,000 people hours during the fiscal year,” Leland said. “Our challenge is to find ways to continue to operate the university effectively and educate its students under these circumstances.”</p>
<p>Leland said she’s confident Georgia College faculty and staff will pull together during these tough times and find creative ways to do as little harm to the university’s 6,600 students as possible.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, the university has a history of people pulling together,” Leland said. “There is a creative, entrepreneurial spirit here. I’m confident we’ll figure it out.”</p>
