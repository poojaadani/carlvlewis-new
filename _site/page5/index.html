        Critique: "Agreement Groups in the United States Senate"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2012</span>

    <p>Take a look at <a href="http://friggeri.net/senate/">this</a> fascinating visualization of U.S. senate agreement groups made by Ph.D. student <a href="http://friggeri.net/">Adrian Friggeri</a>. Using a complex agreement algorithim based upon data from <a href="http://govtrack.us">GovTrack.us</a>, the visualization displays how much all 100 senators of each U.S. Congress during the last 15 years have crossed the aisle –– or stuck to party lines –– on senate-floor votes.</p>
<p>From a design standpoint, the visualization is nearly flawless. The thin red and blue lines help the user form an instant party association, and the light gray bars in the background distinguish each Congress from the next without leading to visual clutter. What's perhaps most impressive is that, despite the fact that the visualization contains far more than 100 different data points, the information is still fairly easy to access and the interface is stil simplistic in feel. Because each Senator's entire individual trajectory is highlighted on mouseover, users can get a glimpse at how willing their respective Senator has been to negotiate a compromise across party lines over the years.</p>
<p>Most of all, the visualization does what all good visualizations should do: tells a story without text. As we can see, the number of Democrats who have crossed the aisle is notably larger than that of their GOP counterparts. This becomes ever more clear when we drill down to look at each party's trajectory individually, where the connections can be seen more clearly. Perhaps what I would've liked to have seen in addition, however, is some sort of summary or average value of the disparity between the two parties on agreement rates, even if just a number at the bottom of the visualization. As it stands, the user has to dissect the visualization a good bit to tell that Democrats have a higher "agreement rate" than Republicans.</p>
<p>The networked line structure reminds me a lot of the Wall Street Journal's <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/wtk/">"What They Know"</a> visualization, except that this visualization has a good bit less clutter and complexity, and much better styling choices.</p>

        Response to Norman, "Emotional Design"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Apr 2012</span>

    <p>Good aesthetics are more than just fluff when it comes to design. They are a core part of a product's functionality. Such is the argument Donald A. Norman makes in his insightful 2005 book <em>Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things. </em>For Norman, attractive things work better by boosting the mood of the user and therefore allowing him or her to think more clearly and operate it more efficiently.</p>
<p>Undergirding Norman's thesis that aesthetics directly influence operability is his distinction between the three basic levels of human cognition: the visceral (jumping at a sudden sound in a quiet room), the behavioral (relaxing in the solitude of a quiet room) and the reflective (thinking to oneself about why a quiet room is more enjoyable). As Norman asserts, these three levels of thought processing "interact with one another, each modulating the others" (7). You cannot escape the effect that one level of thought processing has on the other. As such, a visceral reaction to an external stimuli influences the subsequent behavioral reactions we have, which in turn influence our reflective conclusions about the stimuli itself. If we have a negative visceral reaction to a poorly design website, our mood is negatively affected in such a way that hinders our ability to navigate and use the site, even if there's nothing wrong with the navigation or user interface from a technical standpoint. All our brain can focus on is the poor design. This reaction is similar to the way humans form first impressions of others; if an individual makes a poor first impression (a visceral reaction), we are less likely to act on his or her future actions or speech (a behavioral reaction), which in turn affects the entire way we think about that person (a reflective reaction).</p>

        Respons to Saffer, "Designing for Interaction"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Apr 2012</span>

    <p>Interactive designer Don Saffer artfully captures both the practical and the theoretical aspects of his profession in his 2006 book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Interaction-Creating-Applications-Devices/dp/0321432061">Designing for Interaction: Creating Smart Applications for Clever Devices.</a> </em>From its title, Saffer's book may sound like a simple "how-to" guide to creating web apps with interactivity. Yet while it is certainly that to an extent, the book is more broadly a treatise and exploration of the ideology and terminology behind interactive design.</p>
<p>Saffer sets out to answer seemingly simple questions such as "What is interaction design?" and "What is the value of interaction design?" with thoughtful, reflective analyses. The principle purpose of interaction design, he argues, is "its application to real problems" and its ability to "solve specific problems under a specific set of circumstances" (5). As such, interaction design is inherently attached to the physical world, and is "by its nature contextual," changing and evolving in its definition over the course of time and space (4). Paradoxically, however, Saffer argues that the core principles of good interaction design are "technologically agnostic," and don't change along with ebbs and flows of technological innovation: "Since technology frequently changes, good interaction design doesn't align itself to any one technology or medium in particular" (7). How can Saffer simultaneoulsy assert that interaction design is tethered to its particular context in time, while in the same breath arguing that it remains unchanging in its core values? Don't the two statements on some level contradict one another? Saffer would likely respond by saying that only the "principles" behind interaction design – helping people communicate with one another and, to a lesser degree, with computers – remain constant amid technological upheaval. But this view verges on downplaying the power of future technological change to fundamentally alter every known aspect of the way we communicate. What if, in ten years, a technology comes along that automates communication in such a way that leads to a paradigmatic shift in the role of the interaction designer? Although Saffer is correct in his assertion that even the rise of the Internet has not so far altered the core principles of interaction design, that doesn't mean that such constancy will always be the case.</p>

        On Richard Boarman's "Bubble Trees: The Visualization of Hierarchical Structure"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Apr 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/response-to-boardman-bubble-trees-the-visualization-of-hierarchical-structure/"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/Bildschirmfoto-2011-06-22-um-14.58.48.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>
    In his brief two-page paper "Bubble Trees: The Visualization of Hierarchical Structure," <a href="http://richardboardman.com/">Richard Boardman</a> proposes a new type of interactive presentation of hierarchical data that he calls the bubble tree. To bolster his argument, Boardman points out the difficulties inherent in the traditional "tree" structure, which suffers from the "breadth versus depth" problem by leading to information overload and taking up too much screen real estate. As a solution, he proposes a clickable bubble tree that leads to child and grandchild bubbles. Because of its interactive nature and nested structure, Boardman's bubble tree would "naturally allow the user to explore and work out relationships for themselves," he says.</p>
<p>Since the publication of Boardman's paper, this style of bubbletree has become somewhat ad nouveau in the information design community, with popular JavaScript libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/okfn/bubbletree/wiki/Bubble-Tree-Documentation">Bubbletree.js</a> putting the creation of complex, hierarchical bubble trees into the hands of the general web development public. As its popular use has demonstrated, Bubbletree.js can be particularly handy when it comes to displaying Open Spending data.</p>

        Why does YouTube have a longer lifespan than other platforms?

    <p>[caption id="attachment_2177" align="aligncenter" width="393" caption="Chart provided by bitly."]<a href="http://carlvlewis.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/halflife_density-1.png"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/halflife_density-1.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>

<p>When trying to reach a mass audience, what's the best platform to share your content? Well, the obvious answer is as many places as you can. But according to a post by <a href="http://blog.bitly.com/post/9887686919/you-just-shared-a-link-how-long-will-people-pay">bitly</a> analyzing traffic patterns, links shared on YouTube have a lifespan of 7.3 hours, compared to 2.8 hours on Twitter and 3.4 hours on Facebook. Why such the disparity? Why does YouTube have such a longer lifespan?</p>
<p>Is it because video has a longer lifespan than all other forms of content? Or is it because YouTube has a different user-experience than other social media platforms? While YouTube content is slower to peak, it lasts far longer in the online ecosystem than content posted on other social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. The most obvious answer for the cause of this phenomenon would be that video is a medium that inherently captures our attention for a longer, and slower, period of time. We tend to go back, rewatch and share video more than we do text-based content, causing video to have a longer lifespan.</p>
<p>But there's also another possible explanation for YouTube's lengthier half-life. It could just be the nature of YouTube's network structure. Facebook and Twitter are more of aggregators than YouTube, which is a <em>platform</em> for user-generated content rather than just a portal. So, because of their vast user base and high rate of captivity, Facebook and Twitter by their nature attract attention quicker. But that attention is often only surface attention, which is possibly a reason those networks have a shorter half-life than YouTube. People go to YouTube videos more frequently as a <em>destination, </em>whereas other social media platforms only act as a<em> portal.</em></p>
