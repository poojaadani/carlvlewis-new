        Visualizing 2012 census estimates using CartoDB and Leaflet
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Aug 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/introducing-the-new-dosavannah-com-and-do-mobile-app/"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2012-05-27-at-12.24.52-AM.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>
    I've been tinkering around with some new mapping tools lately, and figured I'd put them to good use by displaying the <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/">2011-2012 population estimates</a> released last week by the U.S. Census Bureau. The inherently geographical nature of the census makes it a data set just begging to be mapped.</p>
<p>Rather than the de facto <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps JavaScript API V3</a>, I decided to go with <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> and <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">Leaflet</a> to see what I could produce.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a recent <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/?p=2422">post</a>, CartoDB offers an excellent <a href="http://google.com/fusiontables">Fusions</a>-esque interface, although it allows for far less front-end customization and requires more beneath the hood programming. Nonetheless, CartoDB can make pretty maps right out of the box, which you can then fully customize using the CartoDB API and basic SQL statements. There's one caveat, however: The service only allows you to upload 5 tables for free. That could be a dealbreaker for cash-strapped news organizations and freelance data journalists.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I downloaded a .zip shapefile package of all 159 Georgia counties from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/co2000.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, then brought the package into CartoDB using the service's default upload interface. Using Excel, I calculated the <a href="http://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/percent/change.html">percent change</a> from the most recent population estimates to last year's estimates. I then added the resulting values as a column in my CartoDB table, which you can see <a href="https://carlvlewis.cartodb.com/tables/2948">here</a>.</p>
<p>After playing a bit with the <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/documentation/cartodb-apis.html">API</a>, I was able to format a diverging chloropleth map from my table with the following style parameters, written using <a href="http://0to255.com">0to255</a> to ensure an equidistant color scheme:</p>
<pre name="code" class="css">
#statewidepop {
   line-color:#FFFFFF;
   line-width:1;
   line-opacity:0.52;
   polygon-opacity:1;
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=5.5] {
   polygon-fill:#558740
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=4] {
   polygon-fill:#609948
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=3] {
   polygon-fill:#6AA84F
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=2.25] {
   polygon-fill:#BECFA8
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=1.5] {
   polygon-fill:#D0D8BB
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=0.75] {
   polygon-fill:#B8CCA1
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=0.3] {
   polygon-fill:#D9DCC4
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=0] {
   polygon-fill:#D3BAAF
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=-0.5] {
   polygon-fill:#E7D1C5
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=-1] {
   polygon-fill:#D8A696
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=-2] {
   polygon-fill:#C36E59
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=-3] {
   polygon-fill:#BC5942
}
#statewidepop [percent_change<=-4] {
   polygon-fill:#B34027
}
#tl_2009_13_county[percent_change<=-5] {
   polygon-fill:#AB2B10
}
</pre>
<p>Check out the resulting map:</p>

<p><em></em></p>
<p>The map above shows the percent change in population from July 2010 to July 2011 in all 159 Georgia counties, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. The darker the green, the higher the positive percent change. The darker the red, the higher the negative percent change. Click on a county to see its percent change.<br />

<p>Pretty nice, huh? But what if I want to customize the style of the pop-up windows or perform more advanced functions like creating custom image markers or switching between layers? That's where <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">Leaflet</a>, an open-source JavaScript library, comes in handy.</p>
<h1>Using the Leaflet library</h1>
<p><iframe src="http://carlvlewis.net/leaflet/home%20copy.html" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" width="530" height="305"></iframe></p>
<p><em>The map above displays the estimated percent change in population of various midstate counties between July 2011 and July 2012. The greener the county, the higher its percent increase. The deeper red the county, the higher its percent decrease. Click on a county to see more precise totals, or select a group from the dropdown in the top right corner for a breakdown of the population changes by race.</em></p>
<p>To get a wider range of flexibility, I called up a segment of the statewide data – the counties within the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CHsQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMacon%2C_Georgia&amp;ei=77LBT8O0B6al2AW6qYlk&amp;usg=AFQjCNFR3fNx8wCTK88zuWVl30ObDsMuwg">Macon/Warner Robins</a> metropolitan area – using the <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">Leaflet</a> javascript. Leaflet allows you to reference layers from CartoDB or Google Maps from within its API, making integration a breeze. All you have to do is reference a <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/documentation/cartodb-apis.html#section-7">few lines of code</a> and your CartoDB data will appear as a layer on your Leaflet map automagically. But even on its own, Leaflet is pretty robust, especially for being so lightweight.</p>
<p>In the map above, I took the county shapefile package from earlier, converted it to GeoJSON using <a href="http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis">QGis</a>, then, following these <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/reference.html#geojson">parameters</a>, called up the GeoJSON data for the selected counties using the Leaflet script. For the underlying map tiles, I created a custom style using Cloudmade, then referenced it using my API key and the following line of script:</p>
<pre class="javascript">var cloudmade = new L.TileLayer('http://{s}.tile.cloudmade.com/41fc7e18cef34d6fb34756efd8240787/63501/256/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',</pre>
<p>Because I also wanted to show a breakdown of the data by race for the same geography, I added in a <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/reference.html#control-layers">custom control</a> menu that allows the user to switch between layers for easy comparison. In addition, I styled the popup to my liking, with green and red values to connote increase and decrease.</p>
<p>From there, I was able to add in the additional data sets of population change by race. For each demographic group, I created a corresponding <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/reference.html#layergroup">layer group</a>. Each layer group contained the data as well as the appropriate styles and colors. See the source code below:</p>
<pre name="code" class="javascript">var totalLayer = new L.LayerGroup();

citiesLayer.addLayer(geojsononeLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsontwoLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonthreeLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfourLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfiveLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonsevenLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsoneightLayer);

var whiteLayer = new L.LayerGroup();

whiteLayer.addLayer(geojsononewhiteLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsontwowhiteLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonthreewhiteLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfourwhiteLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfivewhiteLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonsevenwhiteLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsoneightwhiteLayer);
var blackLayer = new L.LayerGroup();

blackLayer.addLayer(geojsononeblackLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsontwoblackLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonthreeblackLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfourblackLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfiveblackLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonsevenblackLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsoneightblackLayer);

var asianLayer = new L.LayerGroup();

asianLayer.addLayer(geojsononeasianLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsontwoasianLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonthreeasianLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfourasianLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfiveasianLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonsevenasianLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsoneightasianLayer);

var otherLayer = new L.LayerGroup();

otherLayer.addLayer(geojsononeotherLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsontwootherLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonthreeotherLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfourotherLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonfiveotherLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsonsevenotherLayer)
           .addLayer(geojsoneightotherLayer);

map.addLayer(citiesLayer);

var overlayMaps = {
    "Total Population": citiesLayer,
    "White": whiteLayer,
    "Black": blackLayer,
    "Asian": asianLayer,
    "Other/Mixed": otherLayer
};

var layersControl = new L.Control.Layers(overlayMaps);

map.addControl(layersControl);</pre>
<p>All of this was accomplished using the built-in components of the Leaflet JavaScript API and only an hour or so of data analysis in Excel. Next goal? Adding <a href="http://palewi.re/posts/2012/03/26/leaflet-recipe-hover-events-features-and-polygons/">mouseover capabilities</a>.</p>

        What we can learn about charts from The WSJ Guide to Information Graphics
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>Although geared primarily toward the production of static graphics for print publications, Dona M. Wong's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Street-Journal-Guide-Information-Graphics/dp/0393072959">The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics</a> (</em>2010<em>) </em>provides a wealth of salient and time-honored tips and guidelines that any student of data visualization would be well-advised to follow.<!--more--> At the heart of Wong's book is the notion that data integrity trumps all else, and no matter how aesthetically pleasing or visually powerful an information graphic may be, if it doesn't communicate clear and accurate data to the reader/user, it doesn't do its job.</p>
<p>In the first two chapters of The WSJ Guide, <a href="http://donawong.com">Wong</a>, a former student of data viz extraordinaire <a href="http://edwardtufte.com">Edward Tufte</a>, addresses the topic of charting. From a theoretical standpoint, Wong lays out four principle steps to the charting process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research: </strong>Find your data source, and ensure that it's timely, authoritative and free of bias.</li>
<li><strong>Edit: </strong> Figure out what the data says (essentially, determine what your story is), and conceive of how best to boil that data down in a way that's simple enough for your intended audience to understand without skewing its meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Plot: </strong>Determine the appropriate chart type for your data (e.g. bar, column, line, pie, stacked bar, etc.), choose the right settings (scale, increments, axes, etc.), labeling the chart (e.g. legends and source lines) and pick the best color and typography combinations to accentuate your key message.</li>
<li><strong>Review: </strong>When you're done, ask yourself the following questions: Does the data match up with what external sources say? Are there any outliers? Does the chart make sense? What would the average user/reader think upon first seeing the chart?</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the finer points of charting, Wong does an excellent job at pointing out the various dos and don'ts of the presentation process.  She sets forth clear guidelines about when to use what type of chart. For example, when dealing with change over time, Wong says to always use a line chart instead of a bar chart, as bar charts should ideally be reserved for comparing several different series of data. Also, Wong asserts, pie charts usually aren't as good of a choice for displaying complex data as bar or line charts, primarily because they make it harder to discern discrete differences in size (later, she flat-out dismisses the donut pie chart for the same reason). A few of her other tips I found particularly relevant included: (a) avoiding high-contrast color schemes that draw attention away from the data, (b) shying away from icons with high detail so as to avoid visual overload, (c) never, under any circumstances, add cloying shadow or 3D-effects and (d) never rely on zebra patterns, dotted lines or other fancy methods of labeling. "A chart is not a piece of fine art," Wong says.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Wong sets forth some other general principles to help designers avoid creating misleading charts. For example, when creating a bubble chart, always plot the bubbles by area, not radi. Also, never plot two different data series on noncomparable scales, and when creating bar charts, <em>always</em> start at the zero baseline. Other steps to ensuring data integrity include putting numbers into their appropriate context (comparing apples to apples), holding off on rounding until the end of the data analysis process and avoiding charting predictive numbers alongside actual ones. As Wong so eloquently puts it, "Unlike a misspelled word in a story, one wrong number discredits a whole chart."</p>
<p>Although the new addition of interactivity to chart design adds another layer of complexity to the visualization process that Wong doesn't address here, most of the guidelines she sets forth hold true in both static and dynamic mediums. Yet it would be interesting to hear what she has to say about the vexing question of when and when not to add static labels to interactive charts...</p>

        Making the case for hover interactions in maps
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/introducing-the-new-dosavannah-com-and-do-mobile-app/"><img class=" wp-image-3841" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2012-05-06-at-9.28.14-PM.png" alt="Fred Brown / Getty Images" /></a>
    In keeping with my recent spate of mapping nerdiness, I decided to take an <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/?p=2742">interactive map</a> I produced last month displaying statewide annual population changes a step further by adding mouseover/hover capabilities. <!--more-->Here's the <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/?portfolio=interactive-statewide-population-change-between-2010-and-2011">hover-y, nicely-colored chloropleth map</a> I came up with. But before I get into the nitty-gritty of how I created the map –– which I'll explain step-by-step in a later post –– let me exercise a bit of self-indulgence by defending my growing belief in the need for hover capabilities when visualizing geographic data.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I was an avid believer in the <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/03/08/making-maps-1/">no-frills, less-interactivity-is-more approach</a> to mapping geographic data, espoused by the brilliant Brian Boyer (<a href="http://twitter.com/brianboyer">@brianboyer)</a>, News Applications Editor for NPR and a former member of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/tribapps">News Apps Team</a> at <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>. Boyer's <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/03/08/making-maps-1/">argument</a> for the need to keep maps simple –– like they used to be back in the days of ink and paper –– certainly has its merits. After all, the process of bringing a physical map closer to one's eyes to get a better view is a natural, timeless user interaction, and maps like <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/03/08/making-maps-1/">this one</a>, which Boyer produced during his time at <em>The Tribune</em>, are far more intuitive in communicating information upon first glance than many of the infoWindow-laden Google maps being produced by news organizations these days, many of them simply for the sake of being called 'interactive' (for those of you fortunate enough not to be mapping nerds, infoWindow is just Google-speak for the clickable popup boxes you see in Google maps).</p>
<p>But Boyer's minimalist mapping aesthetic only really works when you have one or two pieces of textual data you want to display for each geographic area. What if you have multiple pieces of information you want to display for each polygon, such as in <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/texas-counties-and-demographics/census/on-the-records-majority-texas-minority-races/">this snazzy map</a> from The Texas Tribune? Or, less likely but equally problematic, what if you need to bind non-textual data to your geographic polygons, such as <a href="http://mapbox.com/wax/">images</a> or Google Charts?  In cases such as these, you're going to need to provide some sort of interaction that allows the user to expand and collapse the data for each area individually, or you'll just end up with a chronic case of visual overload.</p>
<p>Not to mention, on a more abstract level, studies have repeatedly shown that users tend to spend more time on applications that provide direct feedback based upon their actions, even if that feedback sometimes makes their ability to consume information at first glance less efficient (see Donald Norman's 2005 book <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/841.Emotional_Design">Emotional Design: Why We Love (Or Hate) Everyday Things</a>, </em>in which Norman asserts that the feeling of emotional satisfaction and empowerment users receive from triggering an action not only puts them in a clearer state of mind, but also makes them more engaged in the information at hand). So, if we're trying to communicate geographic data to users as effectively as possible, it only makes sense that we'd want to have a certain degree of user interaction –– both for the sake of preventing visual overload and for making users feel more engaged. Such is the logic behind clickable infoWindows.</p>
<p>Still, clickable popups leave us with another problem: Users have to make the conscious and deliberate effort to click a polygon to see the data for that geographic area. Requiring clicks may sound like a trivial task to the designer or journalist-programmer, but for the short-attention span user, it can be an awful lot to ask for. To be fair, however, click-triggered popups may not be much of a problem for maps with only a few dozen polygons. But for maps with hundreds of small polygons –– say, census tracts or zip codes –– it can be very tedious to click the right polygon without first having to zoom into the map so far that you lose sight of the broader context.</p>
<p>That leads me back to a conversation I had a couple of months ago with a friend of mine from Columbia's J-School, Michael Keller (<a href="http://twitter.com/mhkeller">@mhkeller</a>), who's now working as the Senior Data Reporter at The Daily Beast. Michael insisted to me after a Hacks/Hacker event that providing hover interaction for maps is almost always a good thing, because hovers require less work on the part of the user. I'll admit that I was dubious at the time, thinking of hovers as often unwanted, accidental triggers that can be distracting to the map and data at hand. But lately I've come around to his way of seeing things. If implemented correctly (i.e. no flashy interactions that cover up other parts of the map), hovers are almost always a good idea. For example, <a href="http://thenewyorkworld.com/public/2012/may/nyw-hotspots-map/index.php">this</a> recent map of New York Stop-and-Frisk data that Keller produced for <a href="http://thenewyorkworld.com">The New York World</a> using CartoDB and Leaflet is so detailed that it couldn't possibly have worked without infoWindows, and would have been unwieldy if it relied on click-triggered interaction. By including floating mouseover capabilities, the map allows the user to scan quickly through the chloropleth map to see individual Stop-and-Frisk data from each block, without having to attempt to click through minute geographic areas.*</p>
<p>I'm certainly not advocating interaction for interaction's sake (although such a case could be made, given the dynamics of the Web). But I am saying that hovers give more immediate visual feedback than click-triggered events, especially in maps. Hovers help draw users into the data without requiring them to seek it out consciously–– almost like a catchy lede would in a print narrative. So for the time-being, I'm pro-hover.</p>
<p><em>*Keller later messaged me letting me know that some examples which better illustrate the power of hovers include <a href="http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/2012/01/10/redistricting/">this map</a> and <a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/114554/2010-voting-patterns-2012-district-lines-bigger-majorities/">this map</a>, both of which use hover functionality to help highlight the effects of proposed redistricting efforts in the New York State Senate. What you'll also notice about Keller's maps is that they include hover states, which I also think is a necessity, especially for maps that include lots of small polygons.</em></p>

    An ever-so-sleek responsive portfolio site I designed for a friend in less than 20 minutes using Skeleton as a foundation.[/caption]</p>
<p>With all this talk lately of the new era of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive design</a>, I realized today that I've yet to create anything that's actually responsive. Given that I've only pondered using it in the implementation of complex, database-driven news sites, the task of tweaking every level of CSS to fit perfectly into a responsive grid system has so far seemed too daunting to tackle.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But I got curious this afternoon, and found my way upon a cool new library called <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>, which bills itself as a "a beautiful boilerplate for responsive, mobile-friendly development." Essentially, Skeleton is a collection of CSS and JS files that makes the mystery of responsive design seem a little less illusive. Upon uploading the package to my server, I was pleased to find a neatly-coded, easy-to-understand responsive site that I could play around with and tweak to my own liking. I ended up adjusting the grid size and performing some minor customizations to the underlying Skeleton structural CSS, but other than that, the development kit was, as it promised, "style agnostic."</p>
<p>Since I didn't have any specific projects I needed to be working on today, I decided to give Skeleton a whirl by designing a <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/responsive">new online portfolio</a> as a favor for my friend Daniel Medina. I'm not kidding – within 10 minutes I'd coded a fully satisfactory responsive portfolio site that looks beautiful on my iPhone and tablet.</p>
<p>So, if you're feeling experimental, try Skeleton out. It's exciting to see how quickly this technology is catching steam, and to see the actual workings of the responsive CSS in action firsthand. My next goal is to integrate a responsive layout into a more-powerful database-driven site, perhaps one designed in <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>.</p>

    <p>[su_quote cite="Geoffrey Bowker" url="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/raw-data-oxymoron"]"Raw data is both an oxymoron and a bad idea; to the contrary, data should be cooked with care."[/su_quote]<br />
Bowker was spot on in his comments made last week at Columbia Journalism School. I can't tell you how many times I've had to make order out of chaos from "raw data," i.e. unintelligible, inaccurate spreadsheets.</p>
